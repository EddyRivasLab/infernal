IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER REGARDING PACKAGES INCLUDED WITHIN INFERNAL

This note concerns installation of the 'rigfilters' sub-package.
The rigorous filtering programs written by Zasha Weinberg relies
on an external library.  CFSQP is a non-linear programming
library; its license terms do not allow us to distribute the
complete library in this package - the primary source file must
be obtained by the end-user (freely available for academic
purposes, though).  http://www.aemdesign.com

Compilation of the source for the rigfilters executables (cm2hmm
and cm2hmmsearch) requires that CFSQP must be obtained separately
and specified at configuration time.

These options to configure are required to enable rigorous filters:
./configure --with-rigfilters --with-cfsqp=/path/to/cfsqp
If the configure script cannot locate cfsqp based on the given path
rigorous filters will be disabled.
