.SH NAME
.TP 
cmstat - display summary statistics for a CM

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cmstat
.I [options]
.I cmfile

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B cmstat
calculates and displays various types of statistics describing the 
covariance models (CMs) in
.I cmfile. 

.PP
CM files are profiles of RNA consensus secondary structure. A
CM file is produced by the 
.B cmbuild 
program, from a given RNA sequence alignment of known 
consensus structure.
CM files can be calibrated with the 
.B cmcalibrate 
program. Searches with calibrated CM files will include
E-values and will use appropriate filter thresholds for
faster speed. It is strongly recommended to calibrate your 
CM files before using 
.B cmsearch.
CM calibration is described in more detail below
and in chapters 5 and 6 of the User Guide.
.B cmstat
is useful for determining statistics on calibrated or
non-calibrated CM files.

By default,
.B cmstat
prints general statistics of the model and the alignment it was built
from. If the model(s) in 
.I cmfile
have been calibrated with 
.B cmcalibrate
the 
.B --le
and
.B --ge
options can be used to print statistics on the 
the exponential tails used for calculating E-values for the various
possible search modes for locally (
.B --le
) and globally configured (
.B --ge
) models in
.B cmsearch.
If 
.I cmfile
is calibrated, HMM filter threshold statistics can be printed for 
local inside CM search with 
.B --lfi,
for glocal inside CM search with
.B --gfi,
for local CYK CM search with 
.B --lfc, 
and for glocal CYK CM search with 
.B --gfc.

The
.B --search
option causes
.B cmstat
performing a timing experiment for homology search. Statistics will be
printed on how many kilobases can be scanned per second for the
different possible algorithms in
.B cmsearch.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -h
Print brief help; includes version number and summary of
all options, including expert options.

.TP
.B -g 
Turn on the 'glocal' alignment algorithm, local with respect to the
target database, and global with respect to the model. By default, 
the model is configured for local alignment which is local with respect to
both the target sequence and the model. 

.TP
.B -m 
print general statistics on the models in 
.I cmfile 
and the alignment it was built from.

.TP
.BI -Z " <x>"
Calculate E-values as if the target database size was 
.I <x> 
megabases (Mb). Ignore the actual size of the database. This option
is only valid if the CM file has been calibrated.

.TP 
.B --all
print all available statistics 

.TP 
.B --le
print local E-value statistics. This option only works if 
.I cmfile 
has been calibrated with 
.B cmcalibrate.

.TP 
.B --ge
print glocal E-value statistics. This option only works if 
.I cmfile 
has been calibrated with 
.B cmcalibrate.

.TP 
.BI --beta " <x>"
With the 
.B --search 
option set the beta parameter for the query-dependent banding
algorithm stages to  
.I <x>
. 
Beta is the probability
mass considered negligible during band calculation. 
The default is 1E-7.


.TP 
.BI --qdbfile " <f>"
Save the query-dependent bands (QDBs) for each state to 
file 
.I <f>
.

.SH EXPERT OPTIONS

.TP 
.B --lfi
Print the HMM filter thresholds for the range of relevant CM bit score
cutoffs for searches with locally configured models using the Inside algorithm.

.TP 
.B --gfi
Print the HMM filter thresholds for the range of relevant CM bit score
cutoffs for searches with globally configured models using the Inside algorithm.

.TP 
.B --lfc
Print the HMM filter thresholds for the range of relevant CM bit score
cutoffs for searches with locally configured models using the CYK algorithm.

.TP 
.B --gfc
Print the HMM filter thresholds for the range of relevant CM bit score
cutoffs for searches with globally configured models using the CYK algorithm.

.TP 
.BI -E " <x>"
Print filter threshold statistics for an HMM filter if a final CM E-value
cutoff of
.I <x>
were to be used for a run of 
.B cmsearch 
on 1 MB of sequence. (Remember 
.B cmsearch 
considers a 500,000 nucleotide
sequence file as 1 MB of sequence because by default 
both strands of the sequence are searched).
The size 1 MB of sequence can be changed to the size of a given
database in file
.I <f>
using the 
.BI --seqfile " <f>" 
option.

.TP 
.BI -T " <x>"
Print filter threshold statistics for an HMM filter if a final CM bit
score cutoff of
.I <x>
were to be used for a run of 
.B cmsearch. 

.TP 
.B --nc
Print filter threshold statistics for an HMM filter if a CM bit score cutoff
equal to the Rfam NC cutoff were to be used for a run of 
.B cmsearch.
The NC cutoff is defined as 
.I <x>
bits in the original
Stockholm alignment the model was built from 
with a line:
.I "#=GF NC <x>"
positioned before the sequence alignment. If such a line existed in the
alignment provided to 
.B cmbuild
then the 
.B --nc
option will be available in 
.B cmstat
If no such line existed when
.B cmbuild
was run, then using the
.B --nc 
option to 
.B cmstat
will cause the program to print an error message and exit.

.TP 
.B --ga
Print filter threshold statistics for an HMM filter if a CM bit score
cutoff of Rfam GA cutoff value were to be used for a run of
.B cmsearch.
The GA cutoff is defined in a stockholm
file used to build the model in the same way as the NC cutoff (see above),
but with a line:
.I "#=GF GA <x>"
.

.TP 
.B --tc
Print filter threshold statistics for an HMM filter if a CM bit score
cutoff equal to the Rfam TC cutoff value were to be used for a run of
.B cmsearch.
The TC cutoff is defined in a stockholm
file used to build the model in the same way as the NC cutoff (see above),
but with a line:
.I "#=GF TC <x>"
.

.TP 
.BI --seqfile " <x>"
With the 
.B "-E"
option, use the database size of the database in
.I <x> 
instead of the default database size of 1 MB.
.

.TP 
.B --toponly
In combination with 
.BI --seqfile " <x>"
option, only consider the top strand of the database in
.I <x> 
instead of both strands.


.B --search
perform an experiment to determine how fast the CM(s) can search with
different search algorithms.

.TP 
.BI --cmL " <n>"
With the 
.B --search 
option set the length of sequence to search with CM algorithms as 
.I <n>
residues. By default, 
.I <n>
is 1000.

.TP 
.BI --hmmL " <n>"
With the 
.B --search 
option set the length of sequence to search with HMM algorithms as 
.I <n>
residues. By default, 
.I <n> 
is 100,000.

.TP 
.BI --efile " <f>"
Save a plot of 
.B cmsearch 
HMM filter E value cutoffs versus CM E value cutoffs in 
xmgrace format to file
.I <f>.
This option must be used in combination with
.B --lfi, --gfi, --lfc
or 
.B --gfc.

.TP 
.BI --bfile " <f>"
Save a plot of 
.B cmsearch 
HMM bit score cutoffs versus CM bit score cutoffs in 
xmgrace format to file
.I <f>.
This option must be used in combination with 
.B --lfi, --gfi, --lfc
or 
.B --gfc.

.TP 
.BI --sfile " <f>"
Save a plot of 
.B cmsearch 
predicted survival fraction from the HMM filter versus CM
E value cutoff in xmgrace format to file
.I <f>.
This option must be used in combination with 
.B --lfi, --gfi, --lfc
or 
.B --gfc.

.TP 
.BI --xfile " <f>"
Save a plot of 'xhmm' versus CM
E value cutoff in xmgrace format to file
.I <f>
 'xhmm' is the ratio of the number of dynamic programming calculations
predicted to be required for the HMM filter and the CM search of the
filter survivors versus the number of dynamic programming calculations
for the filter alone. So, an 'xhmm' value of 2.0 means the filter
stage of a search requires the same number of calculations as the CM search
of the filter survivors does.
This option must be used in combination with 
.B --lfi, --gfi, --lfc
or 
.B --gfc.

.TP 
.BI --afile " <f>"
Save a plot of the predicted acceleration for an HMM filtered search versus 
CM E value cutoff in xmgrace format to file
.I <f>.
This option must be used in combination with 
.B --lfi, --gfi, --lfc
or 
.B --gfc.

.TP 
.BI --bits
With 
.B --efile, --sfile, --xfile, 
and 
.B --afile 
use CM bit score cutoffs instead of CM E value cutoffs for the x-axis
values of the plot.
