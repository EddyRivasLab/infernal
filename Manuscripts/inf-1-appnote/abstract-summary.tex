%\textsc{infernal} is a software package for building
\textsc{infernal} builds 
consensus RNA secondary structure profiles called covariance models
(CMs), and uses them to search nucleic acid sequence databases for
%(CMs), and using them to search nucleic acid sequence databases for
homologous RNAs, or to create new sequence and structure-based
multiple sequence alignments.
