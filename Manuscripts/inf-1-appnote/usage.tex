\section{Usage} 

A CM is built from a Stockholm format \citep{infguide03} multiple
sequence alignment (or single RNA sequence) with consensus secondary
structure annotation marking which positions of the alignment are
single stranded and which are base paired. CMs assign position
specific scores for the four possible residues at single stranded
positions, the sixteen possible base pairs at paired positions, and
for insertions and deletions. These scores are log-odds scores derived
from the observed counts of residues, base pairs, insertions and
deletions in the input alignment, combined with prior information
derived from structural ribosomal RNA alignments.  CM parameterization
has been described in more detail elsewhere
\citep{Eddy94,Eddy02b,infguide03,NawrockiEddy07}.

\textsc{infernal} is composed of several programs that are used in
combination by following four basic steps: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Build a CM from a structural alignment with \emph{cmbuild}.
\item Calibrate a CM for homology search with \emph{cmcalibrate}.
\item Search databases for putative homologs with \emph{cmsearch}.
\item Align putative homologs to a CM with \emph{cmalign}.
\end{enumerate}

The calibration step is optional and computationally expensive (10
hours for a CM of a typical RNA family), but is required to obtain
E-values that estimate the statistical significance of hits in a
database search. \emph{cmcalibrate} will also determine appropriate
HMM filter thresholds for accelerating searches without an appreciable
loss of sensitivity. Each model only needs to be calibrated once.
