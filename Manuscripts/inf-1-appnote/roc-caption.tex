\caption{\textbf{ROC curves for the benchmark.}  Plots are shown for
the new \textsc{infernal} 1.0 with and without filters, for the old
\textsc{infernal} 0.72, and for family-pairwise-searches (FPS) with
\textsc{blastn}. The 1.0 and \textsc{blastn} searches enforced an E-value
cutoff of 1 for gathering hits. The 0.72 search used a bit score
cutoff of 12 bits.  Note that although the pseudogenome is 10 Mb, 20
Mb are searched in the benchmark (10 Mb on each strand).}
