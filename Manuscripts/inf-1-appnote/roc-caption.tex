\caption{\textbf{ROC curves for the benchmark.}  Plots are shown for
the new \textsc{infernal} 1.0 with and without filters, for the old
\textsc{infernal} 0.72, and for family-pairwise-searches (FPS) with
\textsc{blastn}. CPU times are measured for single execultion threads
on 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon processors.}
