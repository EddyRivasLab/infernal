\caption{\textbf{ROC curves for the benchmark.}  Plots are shown for
the new \textsc{infernal} 1.0 with and without filters, for the old
\textsc{infernal} 0.72, and for family-pairwise-searches (FPS) with
\textsc{blastn}. }
%The \textsc{infernal} 0.72 search used a bit score
%cutoff of 12 bits for gathering hits. All other searches used an
%E-value cutoff of 1.}
%Note that although the pseudogenome is 10 Mb, 20
%Mb are searched in the benchmark (10 Mb on each strand).}
