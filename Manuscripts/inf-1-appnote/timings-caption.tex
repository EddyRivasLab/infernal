\textbf{Calibration, search, and alignment running times for six known
    structural RNAs of various sizes.} SSU rRNA and LSU rRNA search
    times were not determined (n.d.); much faster non-CM methods are
    well suited for finding these RNAs, due to their high level of
    primary sequence conservation. CPU times are measured for single
    execution threads on otherwise unloaded 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon
    processors with 8 GB RAM, running Red Hat AS4 Linux operating
    systems.
