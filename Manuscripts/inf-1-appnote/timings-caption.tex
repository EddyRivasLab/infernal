\textbf{Table 1: Calibration, search, and alignment running times for six known
    structural RNAs of various sizes.} CPU times are measured for
    single execution threads on 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon
    processors with 8 GB RAM, running Red Hat AS4 Linux operating
    systems. 
%(\textbf{*}) Faster non-CM methods, such as Blast or
%    HMMs, are recommended for finding SSU and LSU rRNA sequences due
%    to the high level of primary sequence conservation in those
%    families.
