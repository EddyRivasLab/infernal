\textbf{Calibration, search, and alignment running times for six known
    structural RNAs of various sizes.} 
    CPU times are measured for single
    execution threads on otherwise unloaded 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon
    processors with 8 GB RAM, running Red Hat AS4 Linux operating
    systems.

  Faster non-CM methods, such as Blast or HMMs, are
  recommended for finding SSU and LSU rRNA sequences due to the
  high level of primary sequence conservation in those families.}
