\caption{\textbf{CPU time required by CM searches with and without
    QDB.} The time required for searching the 1 Mb target pseudogenome
    with each of the 51 benchmark models is shown as a point, plotted
    on a log-log graph as a function of the average length of the RNA
    sequences in the query alignment; open circles are without QDB,
    and filled circles are with QDB (with the default $\beta =
    1e-7$). Lines represent fits to a power law ($aN^b$), showing that
    for a fixed $L=$ 1 Mb target database size, the standard CYK
    algorithm empirically scales as $N^{2.36}$ and the QDB algorithm
    scales as $N^{1.32}$. The intersection of the empirical fit lines
    is deceptive; empirically, searches with QDB are never slower than
    non-banded searches, even for made-up families with very short
    average query lengths of less than 10 nt (data not shown).}
