Covariance models (CMs) are computational tools used to search for
homologous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in genomic sequences. CMs consider
both primary sequence and structural conservation of the family being
modelled, and have been shown to be very specific and sensitive when
constructed for families for which many (hundreds) of examples are
known. For example tRNAscan-SE is a CM based tool routinely used to
annotate tRNAs in sequenced genomes. But generally, CMs suffer from
two main drawbacks. First, they are very compute-intensive; a search
for RNaseP in the human genome would take roughly 10
compute-years. Secondly, if only a few examples of the family are
known (which is the case for the majority of recognized families),
they perform poorly due to simplistic parameterization strategies.  We
describe our work on alleviating both of these issues. For speed, we
introduce a method for skipping computations that are
probabilistically determined to be unlikely to help identify
homologous sequences. For sensitivity, we've implemented informative
priors and an entropy based weighting scheme, both borrowed from the
profile HMM community. Based on a simple benchmark we report that CMs
are now significantly more sensitive and about four times faster for
an average ncRNA family.
