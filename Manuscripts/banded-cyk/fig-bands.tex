    \caption{\textbf{Effect of transition priors on band calculation.}
      Predicted and actual target lengths are shown for three CMs
      built from alignments of five tRNA, 5S rRNA, and RNaseP
      sequences, which are about 75, 120, and 380 residues long,
      respectively.  Solid vertical lines represent the actual lengths
      of the sequences in each alignment, corresponding with the right
      vertical axis labels. Dashed and dotted curves show QDB
      calculations for $\gamma_0(d)$ for the root state of each model,
      for uninformative versus informative Dirichlet priors,
      respectively.  Dashed and dotted vertical lines show the band
      bounds ($d_{\mbox{min}}(0)$ (left) and $d_{\mbox{max}}(0)$
      (right)) derived from the $\gamma_0(d)$ distributions using
      $\beta = 10^{-7}$. The uninformative plus-one prior results in
      consistent underprediction of target sequence lengths, with a
      broad distribution. The new informative priors produce tighter
      distributions that are centered on the actual subsequence
      lengths. We observe the same result for all other states
      (data not shown).}
