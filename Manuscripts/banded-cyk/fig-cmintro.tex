\caption{\textbf{An example RNA family and corresponding CM.}
  \textbf{(A):} A toy multiple alignment of three RNA
  sequences. \textbf{(B):} The structure of one sequence from (A), the
  same structure with positions numbered according to alignment
  columns, and the guide tree of nodes corresponding to that
  structure, with alignment column indices assigned to nodes (for
  example, node 6, a MATP ``match-pair'' node, will model the
  consensus base pair between columns 4 and 14. \textbf{(C):} The
  state topology of three selected nodes of the CM, for two MATP nodes
  and one consensus ``leftwise'' single residue bulge node (MATL,
  ``match-left'').  The consensus pair and singlet states (two MPs and
  one ML) are white, and the insertion/deletion states are grey. State
  transitions are indicated by arrows.}
