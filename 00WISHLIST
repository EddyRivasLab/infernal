(1) Search Summary [TAJ]
------------------
Wublast has a useful recap at the end of the report. This includes non-default parameters used
(ie switches), as well as DB statistics such as size and number of records. It's not clear how
you'd handle the case where the user specifies the DB size as a switch. I think you'd want to 
report both the size specified (and thus used for E-values), and the actual size. 


(2) E-value _and_ Score cutoff reported [TAJ]
---------------------------------------
Currently, the E-value cutoff is reported. Now that the debugging table converting bit scores
to E-values is no longer included, it would be useful to at least report the bit score that
corresponds to the E-value cutoff. This is most useful if no hits are reported. 


(3) Alignment is Broken/Shifted for large coordinate values [TAJ]
----------------------------------------------------------- 
When the coordinate values are very large (>99,999,999), the coordinate number ends up
shifting the target sequence to the right, so it's no longer properly lined up. 
	Example:

Query = 1 - 65, Target = 155751926 - 155751869
 Score = 29.06, E = 42.62, P = 1, GC =  48

(1) Summarize "canonical basepairs" in match [TAJ]
--------------------------------------------
I know this would break Eric's current parser. But I'd like to see an additional structure
line that summarizes and evaluates the model-imposed structure in terms of canonical 
RNA basepairs. An example, semi-made up, would be as follows:



MODEL      <<<<<<-----<<<<<<__________________~~~~~~>>>>>>------->>>>>>
         1 gCuGGGUUUUUCCuuGuUCGCACCGGACACCUCCA*[12]*gCaaGGUUUUUAUCCCaGu 65
           GCU:::UUUU ::UU :UC  ACCG ACAC U CA      : AA:  UU UAU::: GU
  73425315 GCUAUUUUUUAUUUUAUUCAUACCGUACACAUACA*[16]*ACAAACAUUGUAUGGUCGU 73425384
CANONCIAL  <<x<<<-----x<<<<<__________________~~~~~~>>>>>x------->>>x>>


I propose using "x" as a symbol for pairs that form in the model, but are not Watson-
Crick or G:U in the target alignment. Any symbol could be used, but I prefer one that
has high contrast in ASCII with brackets and other gap symbols (.,_~ etc).
