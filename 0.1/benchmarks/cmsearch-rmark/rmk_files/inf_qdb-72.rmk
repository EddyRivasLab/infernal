# inf_qdb-72.rmk: options for a infernal 0.72 rmark benchmark
#                 with default priors, default entropy weighting
#                 and QDB (default in cmsearch 0.72).
#
# This infernal benchmark corresponds to Table 7 row 3, and the
# "Infernal v0.72, with QDB, \beta=1E-7" ROC curve in Figure 5 of the 
# of the banded cyk manuscript. To duplicate those results, cmsearch 
# and cmbuild must be infernal version 0.72 executables.
