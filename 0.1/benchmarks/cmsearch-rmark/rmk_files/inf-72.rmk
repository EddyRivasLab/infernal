# inf-72.rmk: options for a infernal 0.72 rmark benchmark
#             with default priors, default entropy weighting
#             and no QDB.
#
# This infernal benchmark corresponds to Table 6 row 6, and the
# "Infernal v0.72, non-banded" ROC curve in Figure 5 of the 
# banded cyk manuscript. To duplicate those results, cmsearch 
# and cmbuild must be infernal version 0.72 executables.
