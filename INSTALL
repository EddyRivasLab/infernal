Brief installation instructions 
Infernal @INFERNAL_VERSION@; @INFERNAL_DATE@
-------------------------------------------------------------

These are quick installation instructions. For complete documentation,
including customization and troubleshooting, please see the
Installation chapter in the Infernal User's Guide (Userguide.pdf).

Starting from a source distribution, infernal-@INFERNAL_VERSION@.tar.gz:
 uncompress:                uncompress infernal-@INFERNAL_VERSION@.tar.gz  
 unpack:                    tar xf infernal-@INFERNAL_VERSION@.tar
 move into new directory:   cd infernal-@INFERNAL_VERSION@
 configure:                 ./configure
 build:                     make
 automated tests:           make check
 automated install:         make install

Infernal is designed to run on POSIX-compatible platforms, including
UNIX, Linux and MacOS/X. The POSIX standard essentially includes all
operating systems except Microsoft Windows. We have tested most
extensively on Linux and on MacOS/X, because these are the machines we
develop on.

Infernal depends on vector parallelization methods that are supported
on most modern processors. Infernal requires either an x86-compatible
(IA32, IA64, or Intel64) processor that supports the SSE2 vector
instruction set, or a PowerPC processor that supports the Altivec/VMX
instruction set. If your platform does not support one of these vector
instruction sets, you won't be able to install and run Infernal 1.1 on
it.

Starting from a Git Repo: 

If you have cloned the Infernal Git repository, you'll also
need to clone easel and hmmer too:

   $ cd infernal
   $ git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer
   $ (cd hmmer; git checkout tags/infernal-@INFERNAL_VERSION@)
   $ git clone https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/easel
   $ (cd easel; git checkout tags/infernal-@INFERNAL_VERSION@)
   $ autoconf

You may want to switch to the 'develop' branches of infernal, hmmer
and easel if you want the in-development code.
