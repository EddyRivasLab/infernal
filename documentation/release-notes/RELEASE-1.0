Infernal 1.0rc3
SRE, Wed Sep 24 13:50:33 2008

Infernal 1.0 is the first non-development release of Infernal. The
main differences relative to the last development release (0.8/0.81):

- The cmsearch program is greatly accelerated. It uses HMM and QDB
  filtering methods by default.

- The cmcalibrate program calibrates CM files to give 
  reasonably accurate E-values when searching. This is an
  analog of HMMER2's hmmcalibrate program.

- Infernal now depends only on the Easel library. 
  Dependencies to the old Squid and SSDK libraries are gone.

- Because of the new filtering methods, we have removed support for
  Weinberg "rigorous filters"; this code was problematic because of
  a dependency on a commercial code library.


Release candidate 1 (1.0rc1) was released 20 June 2008.

Release candidate 2 (1.0rc2; 12 July 2008) fixed four bugs:

   - rc1 binaries didn't work on 32-bit systems using gcc compilers.

   - MPI configuration didn't work because of an error in our 
     autoconf configure script.

   - cmemit could erroneously check for a nonexistent --hmmbuild option.

   - cmbuild's help list was incorrectly formatted.

Release candidate 3 (1.0rc3; 24 Sept 2008) fixed several bugs, including:

   - fixed a bug in degenerate residue handling in basepairs;
     previously a pair involving one and only one degenerate residue
     was receiving an IMPOSSIBLE score.

   - bugs fixed in subCM creating in cmalign --sub

   - bugs fixed in posterior probability labeling reported by cmalign

   - cmalign --merge option added

   - some passages in the user guide improved, based on feedback from
     Sanger Institute.
  
   - configuration script improved to deal with older AMD Athlons;
     previously would erroneously detect the Athlon as supporting SSE2
     instructions, but it doesn't.
