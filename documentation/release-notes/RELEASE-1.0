Infernal 1.0rc2
SRE, Sat Jul 12 09:08:10 2008

Infernal 1.0 is the first non-development release of Infernal. The
main differences relative to the last development release (0.8/0.81):

- The cmsearch program is greatly accelerated. It uses HMM and QDB
  filtering methods by default.

- The cmcalibrate program calibrates CM files to give 
  reasonably accurate E-values when searching. This is an
  analog of HMMER2's hmmcalibrate program.

- Infernal now depends only on the Easel library. 
  Dependencies to the old Squid and SSDK libraries are gone.

- Because of the new filtering methods, we have removed support for
  Weinberg "rigorous filters"; this code was problematic because of
  a dependency on a commercial code library.


Release candidate 2 (1.0rc2; 12 July 2008) fixes four bugs in the
initial test release (1.0rc1):

   - rc1 binaries didn't work on 32-bit systems using gcc compilers.
   - MPI configuration didn't work because of an error in our 
     autoconf configure script.
   - cmemit could erroneously check for a nonexistent --hmmbuild option.
   - cmbuild's help list was incorrectly formatted.
