Infernal 1.0
SRE, Fri Jun 20 11:28:58 2008

This is the first non-development release of Infernal.

Main differences relative to the last development release (0.8/0.81):

- The cmsearch program is greatly accelerated. It uses HMM and QDB
  filtering methods by default.

- The cmcalibrate program calibrates CM files to give 
  reasonably accurate E-values when searching. This is an
  analog of HMMER2's hmmcalibrate program.

- Infernal now depends only on the Easel library. 
  Dependencies to the old Squid and SSDK libraries are gone.

- Because of the new filtering methods, we have removed support for
  Weinberg "rigorous filters"; this code was problematic because of
  a dependency on a commercial code library.
