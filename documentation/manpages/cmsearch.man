.SH NAME
.TP 
cmsearch - search a sequence database for RNAs homologous to a CM

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cmsearch
.I [options]
.I cmfile
.I seqfile

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B cmsearch
uses the
covariance model (CM) in
.I cmfile
to search for homologous RNAs in
.I seqfile,
and outputs high-scoring alignments.

.PP
The sequence file can be in most any common biosequence format,
including alignment file formats (in which case the sequences
will be read as if they were unaligned). FASTA format is
recommended.

.PP
CM files are profiles of RNA consensus secondary structure. A
CM file is produced by the 
.B cmbuild 
program, from a given RNA sequence alignment of known 
consensus structure.

.PP
The output that 
.B cmsearch
produces is currently extremely rudimentary. All hits of
score greater than zero bits are output as alignments, in
the order they are found. Niceties like ranking hits by
their score, E-values, and reporting thresholds will come
later.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -h
Print brief help; includes version number and summary of
all options, including expert options.

.TP
.BI -W " <n>"
Set the scanning window width to 
.I <n>.
This is the maximum length of a homologous sequence. 
By default, this is set to 200, which will be too small
for many RNAs. In the future, this
number will be automatically set to something sensible, instead
of relying on you setting it sensibly on the command line.

.SH EXPERT OPTIONS

.TP
.BI --informat " <s>"
Assert that the input 
.I seqfile
is in format
.I <s>.
Do not run Babelfish format autodection. This increases
the reliability of the program somewhat, because 
the Babelfish can make mistakes; particularly
recommended for unattended, high-throughput runs
of @PACKAGE@. 
.I <s>
is case-insensitive;
valid formats include FASTA,
GENBANK, EMBL, GCG, PIR, STOCKHOLM, SELEX, MSF,
CLUSTAL, and PHYLIP. 
See the User's Guide for a complete
list.

.TP 
.B --toponly
Only search the top (Watson) strand of the sequences in
.I seqfile.
By default, both strands are searched.

.TP
.B --local
Turn on the local alignment algorithm, which allows the alignment
to span two or more subsequences if necessary (e.g. if the structures
of the query model and target sequence are only partially shared),
allowing certain large insertions and deletions in the structure
to be penalized differently than normal indels.
The default is to globally align the query model to the target
sequences.

.TP 
.B --dumptrees
Dump verbose, ugly parse trees for each hit. Useful only for
debugging purposes.
