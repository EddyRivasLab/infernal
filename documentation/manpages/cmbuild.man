.SH NAME
.TP 
cmbuild - construct a CM from an RNA multiple sequence alignment

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cmbuild
.I [options]
.I cmfile
.I alifile

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B cmbuild
reads an RNA multiple sequence alignment from
.I alifile,
constructs a covariance model (CM),
and saves the CM to
.I cmfile.

.PP
The alignment file must be in Stockholm format, and
must contain consensus secondary structure annotation.
.B cmbuild
uses the consensus structure to determine the architecture
of the CM.

.PP
The alignment file may be a database containing more than one
alignment.  If it does, the resulting
.I cmfile
will be a database of CMs, one per alignment.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B -h
Print brief help; includes version number and summary of
all options, including expert options.

.TP
.BI -n " <s>"
Name the covariance model 
.I <s>. 
(Does not work if 
.I alifile
contains more than one alignment or in combination with any --c* option listed
below.)
The default is to use the name of the alignment 
(given by the #=GF ID tag, in Stockholm format),
or if that is not present, to use the name of
the alignment file minus any file type extension plus a positive
integer indicating the position of that alignment in the file
(that is, the first alignment in a file "myrnas.sto" would give
a CM named "myrnas.1", the second alignment would give a CM named "myrnas.2").

.TP
.B -A
Append the CM to 
.I cmfile,
if
.I cmfile
already exists.

.TP
.B -F
Allow 
.I cmfile
to be overwritten. Normally, if
.I cmfile
already exists, 
.B cmbuild 
exits with an error unless the
.I -A
or 
.I -F
option is set.

.SH EXPERT OPTIONS

.TP
.BI --rsearch " <f>"
Use RSEARCH's parameterization method with the RIBOSUM matrix in file
.I <f>.
The 
.I alifile
must contain exactly 1 sequence. 

.TP
.BI --rsw
set the window length as 2 * the average sequence length in 
.I alifile


<HERE!>

.I <f>.
The 
.I alifile
must contain exactly 1 sequence. 

.TP
.B --binary 
Save the model in a compact binary format. The default
is a more readable ASCII text format.

.TP
.B --rf
Use reference coordinate annotation (#=GC RF line, in Stockholm)
to determine which columns are consensus, and which are inserts.
Any non-gap character indicates a consensus column. (For example,
mark consensus columns with "x", and insert columns with ".".)
The default is to determine this automatically; if the
frequency of gap characters in a column is
greater than a threshold, gapthresh (default 0.5), the column
is called an insertion.

.TP
.BI --gapthresh " <x>"
Set the gap threshold (used for determining which columns
are insertions versus consensus; see above) to 
.I <x>.
The default is 0.5.

.TP
.BI --informat " <s>"
Assert that the input 
.I alifile
is in format
.I <s>.
Do not run Babelfish format autodection. This increases
the reliability of the program somewhat, because 
the Babelfish can make mistakes; particularly
recommended for unattended, high-throughput runs
of @PACKAGE@. 
.I <s>
is case-insensitive.
This option is a bit forward-looking;
.B cmbuild 
currently only accepts Stockholm format, but
this may not be true in the future.

.TP
.B --wgiven
Use sequence weights as given in annotation in the input alignment
file. If no weights were given, assume they are all 1.0.  The default
is to determine new sequence weights by the
Gerstein/Sonnhammer/Chothia algorithm, ignoring any annotated weights.

.TP 
.B --wnone
Turn sequence weighting off; e.g. explicitly set all
sequence weights to 1.0.

.TP 
.B --wgsc
Use the Gerstein/Sonnhammer/Chothia weighting algorithm. This
is the default, so this option is probably useless.

.TP
.BI --cfile " <f>"
Save a file containing observed count vectors (both emissions and
transitions) to a counts file
.I <f>.
One use for this file is as the starting point for estimating
Dirichlet priors from observed RNA structure data.

.TP
.BI --cmtbl " <f>"
Save a tabular description of the CM's topology to a file
.I <f>.
Primarily useful for debugging CM architecture construction.

.TP
.BI --emap " <f>"
Save a consensus emission map to a file 
.I <f>.
This file relates the numbering system of states in the CM's tree-like
directed graph to the linear numbering of consensus columns. 
Primarily useful for debugging.

.TP
.BI --gtree " <f>"
Save an ASCII picture of the high level structure of the CM's
guide tree to a file 
.I <f>.
Primarily useful for debugging.

.TP
.BI --gtbl " <f>"
Save a tabular description of the nodes in CM's guide tree to a file
.I <f>.
Primarily useful for debugging.

.TP
.BI --tfile " <f>"
Dump tabular inferred sequence tracebacks for each individual
training sequence to a file 
.I <f>.
Primarily useful for debugging.

.TP 
.B --nobalance
Turn off the architecture "rebalancing" algorithm. The nodes in a CM
are initially numbered in standard preorder traversal. The rebalancing
algorithm is an optimizer that reorders the numbering of the CM in
order to absolutely guarantee certain algorithmic performance
bounds. However, it is a stylistic riff that has almost no real
empirical impact on performance, and is a tricky algorithm to get
right. This option was inserted for debugging purposes. It is
sometimes also useful to obtain a simple preorder traversal numbering
system in the CM architecture (for illustrative purposes,
for example).

.TP
.BI --regress " <f>"
Save regression test information to a file
.I <f>. 
This is part of the automated testing procedure at each release. 

.TP
.B --treeforce
After building the model, score the first sequence in the alignment
using its inferred parsetree, and show both the score and the
parsetree. This is a debugging tool, used to specify and score a 
particular desired parsetree.
