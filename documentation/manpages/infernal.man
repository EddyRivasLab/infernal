.SH DESCRIPTION

INFERNAL is a suite of several programs for structural RNA sequence
alignment and database homology search. It uses probabilistic models
called "covariance models" (CMs) to represent the likely evolutionary
homologs of a multiple alignment (or single sequence) of a structural
RNA sequence family.  

Along with the Rfam database of RNA families and associated CMs
(http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk), INFERNAL can be used to annotate homologs
of known structural RNA families in genomes.

INFERNAL is closely related to the HMMER software suite for sequence
family analysis using profile HMMs (http://hmmer.org), but is designed
specifically for structural RNA sequence families.  In addition to
modeling the conserved sequence of a family as profile HMMs do, CMs
model the family's conserved, well-nested (non-pseudoknotted)
secondary structure as well. Consequently, CM search and alignment
methods are relatively computationally expensive.  INFERNAL uses
profile HMMs as filters and for deriving constraints to make the CM
methods more practical.

INFERNAL is used in three main modes: to search a sequence database
for new homologs of an RNA family (or annotate homologs in a genome);
to search a CM database (like Rfam) to find what known family a query
sequence belongs to; and to automatically construct large multiple
alignments (i.e. with an effectively unlimited number of sequences)
using a CM representative of a sequence family.

Suppose you have a structurally annotated multiple sequence alignment of a RNA sequence
family of interest, and you want to search a sequence database for
additional homologs. The
.B cmbuild 
program builds covariance model(s) from multiple alignment(s) and
.B cmcalibrate 
determines important parameters for estimating the
statistical significance of database hits to the model in subsequent
searches.

The
.B cmsearch
program searches CM(s) against a sequence database.

Suppose you have sequence(s) that you want to analyze using a
INFERNAL-based CM database like Rfam (http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk).
The
.B cmpress
program formats a covariance model (such as the file you
would download from Rfam) into a INFERNAL binary database.
The 
.B cmscan
program searches sequence(s) against that database.

Suppose you want to align lots of sequences. You can construct a
manageably small structural alignment of a representative set of sequences,
build a CM with
.B cmbuild,
and use the
.B cmalign 
program to align any number of sequences to that CM.

INFERNAL also includes some auxiliary tools for working with large
CM databases.
.B cmfetch 
fetches one or more CMs from a database.
.B cmstat 
prints summary statistics about a CM file.

For compatibility with previous versions of
INFERNAL, as well as with HMMER, the
.B cmconvert
program converts CM files to a few other formats.

The
.B cmemit 
program generates (simulates) "homologous" sequences by sampling from
a CM. It can also generate a "consensus" sequence.

Each program has its own man page.
