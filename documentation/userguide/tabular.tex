\subsection{The target hits table}

The \ccode{--tblout} output option produces the \emph{target hits
  table}.  The target hits table consists of one line for each
different query/target comparison that met the reporting thresholds,
ranked by decreasing statistical significance (increasing E-value).
Each line consists of \textbf{18 space-delimited fields} followed by a
free text target sequence description, as follows:\footnote{The
  \ccode{tblout} format is deliberately space-delimited (rather than
  tab-delimited) and justified into aligned columns, so these files
  are suitable both for automated parsing and for human
  examination. Tab-delimited data files are difficult for humans to
  examine and spot check. For this reason, we think tab-delimited
  files are a minor evil in the world. Although we occasionally
  receive shrieks of outrage about this, we stubbornly feel that
  space-delimited files are just as trivial to parse as tab-delimited
  files.}

\begin{description}
\item[\emprog{(1) target name:}]
  The name of the target sequence or profile. 

\item[\emprog{(2) accession:}]
  The accession of the target sequence or profile, or '-' if none.

\item[\emprog{(3) query name:}] 
  The name of the query sequence or profile.

\item[\emprog{(4) accession:}]
  The accession of the query sequence or profile, or '-' if none.

\item[\emprog{(5) mdl (model):}] Which type of model was used to
  compute the final score. Either 'cm' or 'hmm'. A CM is
  used to compute the final hit scores unless the model has zero
  basepairs or the \ccode{--hmmonly} option is used, in which case a
  HMM will be used. 

\item[\emprog{(6) mdl from (model coord):}]
  The start of the alignment of this hit with respect to the
  profile (CM or HMM), numbered 1..N for a profile of N consensus positions.

\item[\emprog{(7) mdl to (model coord):}]
  The end of the alignment of this hit with respect to the
  profile (CM or HMM), numbered 1..N for a profile of N consensus positions.

\item[\emprog{(8) seq from (ali coord):}]
  The start of the alignment of this hit with respect to the
  sequence, numbered 1..L for a sequence of L residues.
 
\item[\emprog{(9) seq to (ali coord):}]
  The end of the alignment of this hit with respect to the
  sequence, numbered 1..L for a sequence of L residues.

\item[\emprog{(10) strand:}]
  The strand on which the hit occurs on the sequence. '+' if the hit is on
  the top (Watson) strand, '-' if the hit is on the bottom (Crick) strand.
  If on the top strand, the ``seq from'' value will be less than or
  equal to the ``seq to'' value, else it will be greater than or equal
  to it. 

\item[\emprog{(11) trunc:}] 
  Indicates if this is predicted to be a truncated CM hit or not. This will be
  ``no'' if it is a CM hit that is not predicted to be truncated by the end of the
  sequence, ``5''' or ``3''' if the hit is predicted to have one or more
  5' or 3' residues missing  due to a artificial truncation of the
  sequence, or ``5'&3''' if the hit is predicted to have one or more
  5' residues missing and one or more 3' residues missing.
  If the hit is an HMM hit, this will always be '-'. 

\item[\emprog{(12) pass:}] 
  Indicates what ``pass'' of the pipeline the hit was detected
  on. This is probably only useful for testing and
  debugging. Non-truncated hits are found on the first pass, truncated
  hits are found on successive passes.

\item[\emprog{(13) gc:}] 
  Fraction of G and C nucleotides in the hit. 

\item[\emprog{(7) bias:}] The biased-composition correction: the bit
  score difference contributed by the null3 model for CM hits, or the
  null2 model for HMM hits. High bias scores may be a red flag for a
  false positive. It is difficult to correct for all possible ways in
  which a nonrandom but nonhomologous biological sequences can appear
  to be similar, such as short-period tandem repeats, so there are
  cases where the bias correction is not strong enough (creating false
  positives).

\item[\emprog{(15) score:}]
  The score (in bits) for this target/query comparison. It includes
  the biased-composition correction (the ``null3'' model for CM hits,
  or the ``null2'' model for HMM hits). 

\item[\emprog{(16) E-value:}] The expectation value (statistical
  significance) of the target.  This is a \emph{per query} E-value;
  i.e.\ calculated as the expected number of false positives achieving
  this comparison's score for a \emph{single} query against the search
  space $Z$. For \prog{cmsearch} $Z$ is defined as the total number of
  nucleotides in the target dataset (counting each strand
  separately). For \prog{cmscan} $Z$ is the total number of
  nucleotides in the query sequence (again, counting each strand
  separately) multiplied by the number of models in the target
  database. If you search with multiple queries and if you want to
  control the \emph{overall} false positive rate of that search rather
  than the false positive rate per query, you will want to multiply
  this per-query E-value by how many queries you're doing.

\item[\emprog{(17) inc (included?):}] 
  Indicates whether or not this hit achieves the inclusion threshold:
  '!' if it does, '?' if it does not (and rather only achieves the
  reporting threshold). By default, the inclusion threshold is an
  E-value of 0.01 and the reporting threshold is an E-value of 10.0,
  but these can be changed with command line options as described in
  the manual pages.

\item[\emprog{(18) description of target:}] 
  The remainder of the line is the target's description line, as free text.
\end{description}

This table is columnated neatly for human readability, but do not
write parsers that rely on this columnation; rely on space-delimited
fields. The pretty columnation assumes fixed maximum widths for each
field. If a field exceeds its allotted width, it will still be fully
represented and space-delimited, but the columnation will be disrupted
on the rest of the row.

Note the use of target and query columns. A program like
\prog{cmsearch} searches a query profile against a target sequence
database. In an \prog{cmsearch} tblout file, the sequence (target)
name is first, and the profile (query) name is second. A program like
\prog{cmscan}, on the other hand, searches a query sequence against a
target profile database. In a \prog{cmscan} tblout file, the profile
name is first, and the sequence name is second. You might say, hey,
wouldn't it be more consistent to put the profile name first and the
sequence name second (or vice versa), so \prog{cmsearch} and
\prog{cmscan} tblout files were identical? Well, they
still wouldn't be identical, because the target database size used for
E-value calculations is different (total number of target nucleotides
for \prog{cmsearch}, number of target profiles times target sequence
length for \prog{cmscan}, and it's good not to forget this.

If some of the descriptions of these fields don't make sense to you,
it may help to go through the tutorial in
section~\ref{section:tutorial} and read section~\ref{section:pipeline}
of the manual.
