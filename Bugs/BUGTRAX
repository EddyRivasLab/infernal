DESCRIPTION	

If cmalign was used on a set of sequences that are truncated at their
5' or 3' ends, such that the column that would contain either the left
or right pairing partners of a consensus base pair is completely
missing from the alignment (that is, only one column of a consensus
base pair appears, because it is aligned to MATP_ML or MATP_MR state),
the SS_cons line was corrupted; since the consensus annotation was
directly copied to the alignment, if one of the two columns didn't
appear, then either the < or > was missing and the SS_cons annotation
was unbalanced. This situation is now detected properly. A "lone"
MATP_ML or MATP_MR column gets annotated as a ":" instead of "<" or
">" in SS_cons.
