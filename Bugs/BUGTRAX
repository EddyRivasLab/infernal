DESCRIPTION	

If cmalign was used on a set of sequences that are truncated at their
5' or 3' ends, such that the column that would contain either the left
or right pairing partners of a consensus base pair is completely
missing from the alignment (that is, only one column of a consensus
base pair appears, because it is aligned to MATP_ML or MATP_MR state),
the SS_cons line was corrupted; since the consensus annotation was
directly copied to the alignment, if one of the two columns didn't
appear, then either the < or > was missing and the SS_cons annotation
was unbalanced. This situation is now detected properly. A "lone"
MATP_ML or MATP_MR column gets annotated as a ":" instead of "<" or
">" in SS_cons.

DESCRIPTION     

cmalign leaks memory. The smallcyk.c routine vinside() needed
to init a split set around z, which means that more decks can
be allocated beyond z; but the free_*_matrix routines were only
freeing r..z. But, we always alloc/init for all M+1 decks of
an alpha or beta matrix (M decks for shadows); unused decks are
NULL. So, fix by simplification: all free_*_matrix() routines
change to free all 0..M (0..M-1) decks, ignoring NULL decks,
and setting deck[v] to NULL after each free to avoid problems
w/ double free's of reused decks (e.g. END decks).

DESCRIPTION     

CYKScan() was finding hits that root at insert states, which crashes
outside(). Manifests in local alignment mode when the 0->insert->3
path is cheaper than the local begin 0->3 path. Fixed w/ two changes:
First, in scancyk.c, traceback must start at v=0 unless doing
local_begin; previously, it could start at v=1 or 2 also. (This was
not relevant to bug i3, though I initially thought it was - was a bug
nonetheless.)  Second, in modelconfig.c:ConfigLocal(), zero the
transition p's for state 0; only local begin transitions are
active. Note that this means we've lost anything we trained for these
transitions.

DESCRIPTION     

cmscore fails because optimal parse trees from D&C and normal CYK
differ, for random sequence targets. These cmscore tests are too
aggressive. There can be more than one tree tied at the optimal score;
which one is returned is arbitrary. Looks like I'd already realized
this was a problem because cmscore has a --stringent option, but this
option was defaulting to always TRUE, instead of being parsed on the
cmd line. Made it default to FALSE, and added check on command line.

DESCRIPTION     

Alex sends a hammerhead CM and a sequence (BC050488.1/550-824) which
has two obviously bogus hits: a hit from 14..6, 31.83 bits, with only
two nucleotides aligned; and 146..90, 35.42 bits, with a little bit
more than that aligned but not enough. Does not reproduce on Linux;
Alex probably used Alpha/Tru64.

Was only initializing d=0 from 0..W-1 for the BEGL_S states; needs to
be initialized from 0..W. < W becomes <= W at initialization;

CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Tue Nov  7 09:31:40 2006
DESCRIPTION     

Local D&C alignment has been broken starting with version 0.7. EL self
transition scores were incorrectly being added in the outside() and
voutside() functions of smallcyk.c. This at least sometimes resulted
in the correct CYK score but incorrect parsetree, making it difficult
to detect without using cmscore (which compares the parsetree score
with the CYK score). The error was basically an off-by-one (or two in
the case of MP states) error, and a common example of it would be a EL
stretch of 2 residues rather than the correct 1 residue in the
output alignment. The error was also fixed in the outside_b() and
voutside_b() functions, so banded local D&C alignment should be clear
of this bug also. SVN revision 1678 has bug, revision 1679 does not.

DESCRIPTION     

In smallcyk.c::insideT_b_me() I was treating EL as if it has
a band. When I would pop from the stack during a traceback in an EL
state, I would add dmin[v] to it, even though dmin[v] was bogus
when v is an EL. For an example and more on this bug see
~nawrockie/notebook/6_1020_inf_banded_d_and_c_bug/00README and
00LOG. 

Sam's experience with this bug gave him messages like this: 
Assertion failed: yoffset >= 0 && yoffset <= cm->M, file
  smallcyk.c, line 7741
 Abort

I couldn't get this bug to ever crash the program, which is a main
reason there's no test case in bugs.sqc.

But I was unable to reproduce this, and could only find it with
valgrind.

DESCRIPTION     

I was incorrectly enforcing bands in the smallcyk.c::outside_b()
function, as well as in the smallcyk.c::wedge_splitter_b() function. 

In the outside_b() function, there's a special j loop where the 
code considers v->EL transitions. The loop that enforces dmin and dmax
is special b/c the code is not directly accessing beta[v][j][d] but
rather beta[v][j+{0,1}][d+StateDelta(cm->sttype[v])], so we have
to change the 'for(d=dmin[v]; d<=dmax[v]; d++)' to 
'for(d=dmin[v]-dv; d<=dmax[v]-dv; d++)'. This is line 4979 or
revision 1675 of smallcyk.c.

I couldn't get this bug to ever crash the program, which is a main
reason there's no test case in bugs.sqc.

DESCRIPTION     

cmsearch sometimes segfaults when -W is invoked at the command
line. Problem was in version 0.71 (and current development code, rev
1765) bandcyk.c::BandedCYKScan(), during the scan recursion, the fact
that d is less than W is not checked, rather d must only be < j and <
dmax[v]. The segfault occurs when d is < dmax[v] but > W. The code now
now explicitly checks to make sure d never exceeds W during the DP
recursion. scaninside::BandedInsideScan(),
scaninside.c::BandedInsideScan_jd() and hbandcyk::BandedCYKScan_jd() 
all included the same bug, and were fixed in the same manner.

NOTE: I originally "fixed" this bug with revision 1766, but later
realized that introduced another bug - so it was really fixed with
revision 1772.

CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Wed Jan 10 17:56:33 2007
DESCRIPTION     

If two consensus columns are modelled by the left and right half of 
a single base pair, then the code for checking and detaching so-called
dual-inserts (the sole source of ambiguity in the CM architecture)
incorrectly detached the MATP_IL state, instead of the MATP_IR state.

NOTE: A cp9-test run in testsuites/ will likely still fail for 
      any model with a zero length consensus hairpin b/c they
      represent a special case of CM architecture where a CP9 HMM just
      can't achieve the same first order Markov chain characteristics
      as the CM in the region near the offending 0-length hairpin.
      cp9-test now checks for zero length hairpins and prints a 
      warning to the screen.

XREF            NONE
REPORTED_BY     Eric Nawrocki
CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Thu Nov  8 15:43:50 2007
DESCRIPTION     

The i12 perl script in Infernal's Bugs/ subdirectory has a simple
example of this bug.

In all *outside* functions when adding the basepair emit probability 
to a DP cell, the code attempts to check if the residues are both
non-ambiguous (A|C|G|U) and calls DegeneratePairScore() if they are 
not. However that check was flawed, here's an example:

 if (dsq[i-1] < cm->abc->K && dsq[j+1] > cm->abc->K)
   escore = cm->esc[y][(int) (dsq[i-1]*cm->abc->K+dsq[j+1])];
 else
   escore = DegeneratePairScore(cm->abc, cm->esc[y], dsq[i-1], dsq[j+1]);

Note the 'dsq[j+1] > cm->abc->K'. It should be 'dsq[j+1] <
cm->abc->K'.  This bug has been in the Infernal code since the 0.1
April 2002 release, in which it was only found in outside() and
voutside(). Version 0.81 included more outside functions in which this
bug was propogated, for example IOutside() in cm_postprob.c which is
the instance of the bug that causes the i12 script to fail. I won't
list them here, do a svn diff -r 2199:2200 for the details. To be
explicit, this bug exists in svn revision 2199, and is fixed in svn
revision 2200.

REPORTED_BY     Marcus Claesson, Nat'l University of Ireland, Cork
CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Tue Sep 30 11:15:40 2008
DESCRIPTION     

The i13 perl script in Infernal's Bugs/ subdirectory has a simple
example of this bug.

During development between v0.81 to v1.0 it became apparent that CMs
built with 0 BIF, MATR and MATL nodes (that is just ROOT and MATP
nodes) are problematic because it is IMPOSSIBLE to align a single
residue to them in local mode. This is because a local begin MUST
right into the first MATP_MP state from ROOT_S which necessarily emits
2 residues. The solution I provided was to disallow the building of
such CMs, because they are unlikely to be practical anyway (adding a
single consensus single stranded residue as a loop in between a stem
sidesteps this issue).

However, with cmalign --sub, if you are using a CM with two adjacent
consensus positions that are basepaired to each other (i is base
paired to i+1), you sometimes exit cmalign with an error b/c a sub CM
with 0 MATL, MATR nodes is attempted to be built. This is undesirable
and was reported by the RDP guys (who use such a CM) as a bug.  I
thought I had fixed it between 1.0rc2 and 1.0rc3 but apparently I
hadn't as it was reported in 1.0rc3 by Marcus Claesson from National
University of Ireland, Cork.

The fix is in revision 2597 of the infernal-1.0 branch of the infernal
svn repository. The fix is to only allow such CMs to be built in the
case when we're building sub CMs, which as currently implemented will
never be localized and thus never have the problems mentioned above.

TITLE		cmalign optimal accuracy zero length parsetree bug
STATUS          CLOSED
XREF            See ~/nawrockie/notebook/9_0612_inf_bug_cmalign_enone
REPORTED_BY     Brian Parker, University of Copenhagen
CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Fri Jun 12 16:47:50 2009
DESCRIPTION     

The i14 perl script in Infernal's Bugs/ subdirectory has Brian's 
simple example of this bug.

In rare cases when aligning to a CM using HMM banded optimal accuracy,
the optimal parse, the parse that maximizes the summed posterior
labelling of all emitted residues, requires making an illegal
transition.  Specifically a transition from a v,j,d subtree where d==0
and j and d are perfectly legal (within the hmm bands) to a y,j,d
subtree where d = 0 that is ILLEGAL in that j is outside the j band on
y, or d=0 is outside the d band for y and j.  This caused a seg fault
in version 1.0 of infernal.

The 'fix' for this is not perfect, but does remove the seg fault
behavior. Now the alignment forces the illegal parse tree to become
legal, which does not cause any problems because d=0, that is, no
residues are emitted from the illegal subtree.

However, it is unnerving that an illegal parse is being allowed and
manifests itself only in the trace file (--tfile <x>) by showing an
illegal parse and a EL end in global mode. The specific reason for
this is due to the way the optimal accuracy algorithm is implemented
(cells get initialized to EL) and is explained more in
~nawrockie/notebook/9_0612_inf_bug_cmalign_enone.

It's unclear how to do a proper fix. This is because the optimal
accuracy function: optimal_accuracy_align_hb() returns the parse
that maximizes the summed posterior labeling of all residues in the
target. To achieve this non-emitting states do not contribute at
all to the score being optimized. However to fix the bug I'd have to
have deletes contribute in someway, so that I could distinguish an
illegal parsetree that emits 0 residues from a legal one that emits
0 residues (currently they each have the some score: 0). If I did
allow deletes to positively add to the score then the optimal accuracy
parse would incorrectly contain many deletes, because adding them 
increases the score but does not account for any emitted residues.

This bug was fixed in the infernal 1.0 release branch as of revision
2826, which is a post-1.0 svn  revision of the infernal-1.0 branch,
and in the main infernal trunk as of revision 2828.

TITLE		cmalign optimal accuracy bifurcation with impossible child
STATUS          CLOSED

REPORTED_BY     EPN
CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Tue Nov 17 18:05:21 2009
DESCRIPTION    

This bug is due to another unforeseen pitfall of my optimal accuracy
alignment implementation, that does not occur in CYK or Inside
implementations. In the function
cm_dpalign.c::optimal_accuracy_align_hb(), when the DP cell
alpha[v][j][d] for a B state is being filled in with the max
FLogsum(alpha[y][j-k][d-k], alpha[z][j][k]) for left child BEGL_S (y)
and right child BEGR_S (z) and choice of right fragment length k, it
is possible that either alpha[y][j-k][d-k] and alpha[z][j][k] have
score equal to IMPOSSIBLE *AND* imply a non-zero length parse subtree
(i.e either d-k or k is non-zero), and the score of the non-IMPOSSIBLE
child is sufficiently high to make the combination of it and
IMPOSSIBLE in FLogsum(IMPOSSIBLE, alpha[z][j][k]) be the max score for
all possible choices of k.  The FLogsum is used in this instance b/c
the optimal accuracy alpha matrix is storing the log of the summed
probability of emitting all residues from i..j from left subtree
(i=j-d+1..j-k) and from right subtree (j-k+1..j).

When the above case occurs, alpha[z][j][k] implies an impossible
parsetree b/c either the right or left subtree has an IMPOSSIBLE score
yet must emit some residues, which must have greater than zero
probability (IMPOSSIBLE implies zero probability), and it can result
in a downstream segmentation fault during traceback of the OA alpha
matrix. This is extremely rare. I only encountered it late in
pre-testing the v0.1 release of SSU-ALIGN.  The bug occured and caused
a seg fault for a single sequence out of the 1.1 million SSU sequences
of release 10.15 of RDP.

I fixed the bug by adding code to explicity check to make sure that
neither (alpha[y][j-k][d-k] == IMPOSSIBLE && d-k != 0), nor
(alpha[z][j][k] == IMPOSSIBLE and k != 0) before updating
alpha[v][j][d] and the shadow matrix value. I also made the analogous
change in the non-banded version of the function
cm_dpalign.c::optimal_accuracy_align(), even though I'm pretty sure
the bug could never actually occur when bands are not used. I figured
it was better safe than sorry in this case and the extra running time
is not a big concern b/c if speed is desired, the non-banded function
would not be used anyhow.

This bug was fixed in the infernal 1.0 release branch as of revision
3055, which is a post-1.0.2 svn revision of the infernal-1.0 branch,
and in the main infernal trunk as of revision 3056.

REPORTED_BY     EPN
CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Thu Jun 17 08:03:49 2010
DESCRIPTION    

Backward Viterbi was incorrectly implemented in
cp9_dp.c:cp9_ViterbiBackward(). Certain sequences gave different
results (scores for optimal parses) for cp9_Viterbi(), which runs
Viterbi for CM Plan 9 HMMs in the forward direction (traditional
Viterbi), and cp9_ViterbiBackward() which runs Viterbi backwards.
This affected releases 1.0 through 1.0.2 and Diana's 06.07.10 snapshot
release for her thesis.

The bug was that match emission and insert scores were erroneously not
added to a DP cell's score in some rare cases.  To see the exact code
changed, use 'svn diff'. 

Note, there is no script in bugs.sqc that reproduces this bug. This is
partly because it never causes any of the programs to crash. I added
a debugging program to the end of cp9_dp.c that runs cp9_Viterbi and
cp9_ViterbiBackward() on a set of sequences and outputs the max
score. It must be compiled independently.

This bug was fixed as of svn revision 3309.

REPORTED_BY     EPN
CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Wed Jun 23 06:40:01 2010
DESCRIPTION    

HMM scanning in Infernal consists of two rounds, a 'forward direction'
round where likely end points (j) of hits are determined, and a
'backward direction' round where likely start points (i) for each hit
ending at (j) are determined. Importantly, overlaps are removed after
the 'forward direction' stage, which requires a guess at the start
points (i_guess) for each end point j. Bug i18 is that this guess was
set as i_guess = j-W+1, which had unintended and previously
unrecognized implications on which exact hits would survive and
specifically removed one of two adjacent high-scoring hits in some
cases (when both should have been kept and survived the filter). See
~nawrockie/notebook/10_0614_inf_repro_mpi/00LOG, specifically the
Glycine riboswitch example explored on June 22, 2010 for details and
LMEN1-p22 (my lab notebook) for an example.

The fix is to change how i_guess is calculated to: iguess = j-avglen+1
where avglen is the average length of a hit generated by the model (as
calc'ed in cm.c::cm_GetAvgHitLength).

This fixes some anecdotal cases where one of two adjacent hits were
being thrown out by the HMM filter - now they are both found (again,
see ~nawrockie/notebook/10_0614_inf_repro_mpi/00LOG).

The bug fix has virtually no impact on RMARK2 benchmark performance,
but it does speed up that benchmark by about 20%.

This bug was fixed as of svn revision 3320.

TITLE		Guide tree balancing initialization

REPORTED_BY     Stefan Janssen, Robert Giegerich's group
CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Wed Aug  4 09:24:08 2010
DESCRIPTION    

The choice of split points in bifurcations in a CM guide tree is
handled by cm_modelmaker.c:HandModelmaker(). For all possible split
points k between consensus positions (i,j), the k is chosen that
minimizes the the absolute difference between (k-i) and (j-k+1) (note
that the left subtree will model positions i..k-1 and the right
subtree will model positions k..j). At least that was the intended
behavior in cmbuild, but several bugs (this one and the two described
in i20) prevented this from being the actual behavior.

Between SVN revisions 2568 and 2569 in the Infernal 1.0 release branch
(which was merged to the trunk in svn revision 2588) this balancing
code was modified so that the difference in _consensus_ subtree lengths
was minimized. Prior to that, the difference in _alignment_ subtree
lengths was being minimized (that is the lengths were measured in
alignment coordinates, and thus were influenced by inserts in the
MSA). EPN made those revisions and introduced a serious bug in the
course of those revisions; this is the i19 bug, which is described
next. Looking at the code, or at least at an 'svn diff' output, is
probably necessary for following the discussion below.

The initialization of the best split point sets it to the first
possible split point, which is ct[i]+1. Then the 'bestdiff' variable
is set as a maximal value so that all subsequent possible split points
will necessarily have lower 'diff' values (absolute difference in
consensus length of left and right subtrees resulting from choosing
the current split point k). Thus, 'bestdiff' is meant to always be
changed from its initial value. (The first split point tested is
ct[i]+1, which should always reset bestdiff to the diff resulting from
choosing k=ct[i]+1). The i19 bug is that the initialization of
bestdiff was to 'clen' which I thought was greater than any possible
'diff', but in fact, is simply the number of consensus positions
modeled by the currently growing guide tree. This is completely
wrong because it is sometimes very small and was not always
being overwritten by an actual diff from some valid cut point k.
In such cases, k=ct[i]+1 was being chosen as the optimal split point,
even if it was not. 

The fix, suggested by Stefan, is to initialize bestdiff as msa->alen+1
because the difference in subtree lengths can never exceed this:
msa->alen >= clen, and clen is the maximal value of a subtree length
(actually it's probably clen-1).

This bug was fixed as of revision 3337.

TITLE		Guide tree balancing off-by-ones

REPORTED_BY     Stefan Janssen, Robert Giegerich's group
CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Wed Aug  4 09:24:08 2010
DESCRIPTION    

This bug is closely related to i19 in that it occurs in the same
function (cm_modelmaker.c:HandModelMaker()) and was reported
simultaneously with bug i19 by the same user (Stefan Janssen).  Stefan
also suggested the correct fix for the bug.  Read the DESCRIPTION of
i19 for introduction.

The i20 bug also occurs in the code that chooses the optimal split
point k for a bifurcation. i20 is in fact two bugs, both of which are
off-by-one errors. These bugs existed at least as early as infernal
0.55 and have persisted through the 1.0.2 release. 

The first bug involves the calculation of the absolute difference
between the left and right subtree lengths. This difference should be:
abs(R-L) where L is the consensus length of the left subtree and R is
the consensus length of the right subtree. The left subtree models
i..k-1, so L = k-i. The right subtree models k..j, so R =
j-k+1. Therefore the absolute difference is abs((j-k+1)-(k-i)).  This
could be rewritten as: abs(j+i-2k+1). However, the bug in the code was
that the difference was being calculated as abs(j+i-2k), omitting the
+1 within the abs().

The second bug involves the termination condition of the for loop that
loops through possible split points k. The incorrect loop is:

	  for (k = ct[i] + 1; k < ct[j]; k = ct[k] + 1) 

The correct loop with the correct termination is:

	  for (k = ct[i] + 1; k <= ct[j]; k = ct[k] + 1) 

As Stefan reported, "otherwise you miss possible split points if two
domains are next to each other without any unpaired bases" in
between. Indeed, ct[j] is a valid split point k since the left
subtree/right subtree definitions are i..k-1/k..j, if k==ct[j] (k and
j are paired) and k-1 is the right half of a pair.

This bug was fixed as of revision 3337.

DESCRIPTION    

The cp9_modelconfig.c Prob2Score() function, which converts a
probabilty to a scaled integer log_2 odds score was returning -INFTY
if the passed in probability <p> was less than eslSMALLX1 (5e-9).
This minimum <p> of 5e-9 for returning a valid score was too high
because this function is used to calculate the summed probability mass
(as a scaled integer log odds score) that can be excluded during CP9
HMM banding for cmalign, and that probability should be able to be as
low as 1e-15 or lower. The fix is that the function now only returns
-INFTY if a comparison of p with 0.0 returns TRUE (if (p == 0.) return
-INFTY). This is how HMMER-2.3.2 implemented the same function.
Empirical testing shows this works down to about 1e-44: any <p> below
1e-44 causes -INFTY to be returned.

This bug was fixed as of revision 3338.

CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Tue Oct 19 06:23:05 2010
DESCRIPTION    

The NULL3 correction was incorrectly being applied for hits found in
the HMM banded CYK and Inside scanning functions:
cm_dpsearch.c::FastCYKScanHB() and
cm_dpsearch.c::FastFInsideScanHB(). This bug was due to incorrect code
in two places. First, in cm_mx.c::UpdateGammaHitMxCM(), the
composition of a hit was incorrectly calc'ed when used for HMM banded
scanners b/c <d> is w.r.t HMM bands (i.e. d=2 implies d=hdmin[j][v]+2,
not d actually is 2). Second, in the cm_dpsearch.c scanning functions
themselves the act vector, which is used to determine the composition
of hits within the UpdateGamma, was being improperly initialized; only
values between jmin[0] and jmax[0] were being set, whereas all i0..j0
values should have been.

This bugs only affects HMM banded scanners, non-banded and QDB
scanners are unaffected, which is probably the main reason why it has
persisted in the code until now (HMM banded scanners are non-default
and only used if the cmsearch --hbanded option is used).

This bug was fixed as of revision 3382.

REPORTED_BY     Stefan Janssen, Robert Giegerich's group, University
		of Bielefeld
CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Mon Dec  6 13:20:30 2010
DESCRIPTION    

In alphabet.c::PairCount(), degenerate pairs were being counted
incorrectly. There's notes in that function now regarding this bug.
In that function, when a degenerate residue was encountered we first
determined left[0..abc->K-1] and right[0..abc->K-1]: the fraction of
possible canonical residues that agree with the degenerate symbol
<syml> or <symr> (left and right symbol respectively). For example, if
syml=='N', left[A]==left[C]==left[G]==left[U] = 0.25. These counts
were also weighted by the sequence weight passed into the function, so
if <wt> == 0.8, then actually left[A]==left[C]==left[G]==left[U]=0.20.
Then the count for a pair was determined by multiplying left and
right, for example: pair['AU'] = left[A] * right[U]. However, this was
incorrect because both left and right had already been 'weighted'. In
other words, just because (sum_i left[i]) == (sum_j right[j]) == <wt>,
doesn't mean that (sum_ij left[i]*right[j]) == <wt>, which it
certainly should be. 

As a concrete example, take syml='N', symr='A', and <wt> = 0.8. If we
use the old incorrect method: 
                left  right 
    pair['AA'] = 0.2 * 0.8  = 0.16
    pair['CA'] = 0.2 * 0.8  = 0.16
    pair['GA'] = 0.2 * 0.8  = 0.16
    pair['UA'] = 0.2 * 0.8  = 0.16

and all others will be 0.0. The sum here is only 0.64, but it should
clearly sum to 0.8. 

The fix is to not weight the fractions in the left and right vectors
and set pair[] == left[] * right[] * wt.  In this case, 

                left  right    wt
    pair['AA'] = 0.25 * 1.0 * 0.8 = 0.2
    pair['CA'] = 0.25 * 1.0 * 0.8 = 0.2
    pair['GA'] = 0.25 * 1.0 * 0.8 = 0.2
    pair['UA'] = 0.25 * 1.0 * 0.8 = 0.2

This bug was present at least as far back as infernal 0.55, and
possibly earlier. Thanks to Stefan Janssen for tracking this one
down. I don't think I would have ever found it.

This bug was fixed as of revision 3423.

REPORTED_BY     Paul Gardner
CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Mon Mar 21 08:24:53 2011
DESCRIPTION    

cmbuild.c::refine_msa() is meant to refine the input msa by building a
model, determining the score of all the implicit parse trees, and then
realigning all sequences to the current model. The scores of those
parsetrees are determined and if they're more than 1% higher than the
previous scores (on average), another build and realignment iteration
is performed. This is continued until 1% higher scoring parsetrees are
not found. Paul found a case where it iterated forever. I was unable
to reproduce it, but it seems like it must be due to this line of
code: 

      if(delta <= threshold && delta >= 0) break; /* only way out of while(1) loop */

This is line 775 in infernal 1.0.2's cmbuild. delta is the change in
bit scores of the parsetrees since the previous iteration, calc'ed as:

      delta    = (totscore - oldscore) / fabs(totscore);

It appears as if it's possible that delta can remain < 0 even if the
bit scores don't change, due to precision issues. The fix is to lower
0 to some very small negative number: 

      if(delta <= threshold && delta > (-1. * eslSMALLX1)) break; /* break out of loop before max number of iterations are reached */

I also added a maximum or 200 possible iterations as an additional
safeguard against an infinite loop.

This bug is fixed as of revision r3510.

hit resolution mode, but somehow I failed to realize the bug also
applied to greedy mode. I've applied an analogous fix to what I did
for i22 to fix the greedy mode case. The fix is in
cm_mx.c:UpdateGammaHitMxCM(). See description of i22 above, and

CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Mon Aug 15 11:04:01 2011
DESCRIPTION    

In cm_dpalign.c::CMPostCode() and cm_dpalign.c::CMPostCodeHB(), the
posterior probability for residues emitted by the EL state was being
incorrectly calculated. That value should be calculated as the
posterior probability that residue 'r' was emitted from the EL state
divided by the posterior probability that residue 'r' was emitted from
any emitting state (call this denominator value 'D'). Ideally, D would
be 1.0, but due to precision errors related to the flogsum lookup
table and floating point precision, its important to actually
calculate D (instead of assuming it is 1.0) and use it to normalize
the probability that 'r' was emitted from a given state. Otherwise
you'll get some probabilities slightly > 1.0. 

However, for EL states, the wrong D was being used, instead of using
the D pertaining to residue 'r', D pertaining to residue 'i != r' was
being used. Basically, this was a typo in the code.

The fix was very simple. Use 'svn diff' to see it. (Note that there
are many non-code changes to comments (mainly line spacing)) that are
revealed by an 'svn diff', but there are only a couple of trivial code
changes to fix the bug.

REPORTED_BY     Eric Nawrocki
CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Thu Aug 25 09:13:57 2011
DESCRIPTION    

Marginal emission scores were being incorrectly calculated because the
alphabet.c::LeftMarginalScore() and alphabet.c::RightMarginalScore()
functions were using the esl_vec_FLogsum() function to sum log odds
scores in base 2, but that function operates in log base e.  The
resulting marginal emission scores were wrong, and did not correspond
to valid probabilities (the sum of the marginal probabilities for all
four canonicals was not 1.0). Additionally the implementation in these
functions assumed the null model was always equiprobable for all four
bases, when this is in fact not guaranteed. (cmbuild --null allows the
use of a null model with arbitrary emission probabilities).

The fixed version completely changes how and where marginals are
calculated. It is now in CMLogoddisfy() and the calculation is done
differently, without the use of the esl_vec_FLogsum() function. By
placing the calculation in CMLogoddisfy() we know that the marginal
scores are always valid when any of the CM bit scores are valid, and
we do not need to call the SetMarginals() function to set them up.

As of revision 3666, the old LeftMarginalScore(), RightMarginalScore()
and SetMarginals() functions have been retained but renamed by adding 
'_reproduce_bug_i27' at the end of their names. I did this to allow
reproduction of the benchmark from the Kolbe, Eddy 2009 benchmark, but
I'm not sure if this is too important since other parts of the
codebase have changed as well and I may remove them in a future
revision. All three functions have been moved to truncyk.c.

DESCRIPTION    

Not all variables in a CP9Bands_t objects were being cloned in the
hmmband.c:cp9_CloneBands() function. This function is called in
cm_pipeline.c:pli_final_stage() to clone CP9 bands calculated during
the final Inside search stage that may be needed to align multiple
hits in the same envelope. For example, if there is 2 hits in the
envelope, we clone the bands used in the search step, then shift them
for the first hit (some cells inside the bands may be outside the
first hit boundaries) and compute the alignment of the first hit, then
to align the second hit, we copy the cloned search bands into cm->cp9b
and shift them for the second hit before aligning the second hit.

The bug was that the cp9_CloneBands() function was not cloning the
variables related to truncated alignment, most importantly the
{J,L,R,T}valid arrays. So these were being left as their default
values from AllocCP9Bands() (TRUE for states 1..M for J,L,R,T). These
*valid arrays control what types of truncated alignments are possible
at each state. Then downstream of this we got a failure in rare cases: 

Error: cm_pipeline() failed unexpected with status code 11
pli_align_hit() alignment HB retry mx too big, this shouldn't happen

This is because the cloned bands were being used with *valid arrays
set to all TRUE, and the required size of the matrix was much larger
than it should have been. 

The fix is to copy the truncated-related cp9b variables (most
importantly the *valid arrays) in cp9_CloneBands().

This bug occured rarely, because it only happens in a truncated pass
of the pipeline where there's multiple hits in an envelope which is
rare because truncated passes only occur on the final W residues of
any sequence. I observed it for a single sequence on a search for SRP
(using the SRP model from the Menzel, Gorodkin and Stadler 2009 RNA
paper) on the Macaca mulatta genome - which has in the ballpark of 1
million SRP hits.

CLOSED_DATE     EPN, Tue Oct  9 14:44:51 2012
DESCRIPTION    

Database size gets defined as a 'long' in some contexts. On (at least
some) 32-bit systems the max value is 2,147,483,647 so searching
databases larger than this causes an overflow and (at least sometimes)
negative values for the database size. This can lead to negative
E-values, which are, obviously, problematic. 

No similar problem has ever been observed on 64-bit systems, where
the maximum value for a long is much larger, typically 2^64-1.

The fix is to use doubles for database size in all cases. Previously
double was used for some database sizes (e.g. CM_PIPELINE had a Z
value that was a double) but not all (CM_EXP_INFO had dbsize as a
long).

cmbuild was not allocating sq->ss prior to calling esl_sq_GetFromMSA()

annotation, so this was causing a segmentation fault as strcpy tried
to copy into memory that didn't exist. The fix is to allocate sq->ss
if necessary prior to calling esl_sq_GetFromMSA(). Note that we would
use esl_sq_FetchFromMSA() (which allocates as necessary) except for
our desire to use an ESL_SQBLOCK object for a block of pre-allocated
sequences so that we can use the same functions that cmalign uses to
create alignments (which use ESL_SQBLOCK objects).

DESCRIPTION    

cm_alidisplay.c::cm_alidisplay_BackConvert() was using
HandModelMaker() to construct a CM guidetree from a msa->ss_cons for
use in Transmogrify() to convert aligned sequences to parsetrees.
This failed for some CM files built with version 1.0x and converted to
1.1 format with cmconvert because the code in HandModelMaker() was
changed between v1.0 and v1.1 such that the same SS_cons can lead to
different CM guide trees in v1.0 and v1.1. The changes between 1.0 and
1.1 to HandModelMaker() were to deal with bugs i19 and i20. 

The HandModelMaker() change affected exactly 150 of the 2208 Rfam 11.0
CMs (7%) in the 'cmconvert'ed Rfam.cm file, so this bug affects a
significant number of models. This bug manifests itself with cmsearch
