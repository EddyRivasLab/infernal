DESCRIPTION	

If cmalign was used on a set of sequences that are truncated at their
5' or 3' ends, such that the column that would contain either the left
or right pairing partners of a consensus base pair is completely
missing from the alignment (that is, only one column of a consensus
base pair appears, because it is aligned to MATP_ML or MATP_MR state),
the SS_cons line was corrupted; since the consensus annotation was
directly copied to the alignment, if one of the two columns didn't
appear, then either the < or > was missing and the SS_cons annotation
was unbalanced. This situation is now detected properly. A "lone"
MATP_ML or MATP_MR column gets annotated as a ":" instead of "<" or
">" in SS_cons.

DESCRIPTION     

cmalign leaks memory. The smallcyk.c routine vinside() needed
to init a split set around z, which means that more decks can
be allocated beyond z; but the free_*_matrix routines were only
freeing r..z. But, we always alloc/init for all M+1 decks of
an alpha or beta matrix (M decks for shadows); unused decks are
NULL. So, fix by simplification: all free_*_matrix() routines
change to free all 0..M (0..M-1) decks, ignoring NULL decks,
and setting deck[v] to NULL after each free to avoid problems
w/ double free's of reused decks (e.g. END decks).

DESCRIPTION     

CYKScan() was finding hits that root at insert states, which crashes
outside(). Manifests in local alignment mode when the 0->insert->3
path is cheaper than the local begin 0->3 path. Fixed w/ two changes:
First, in scancyk.c, traceback must start at v=0 unless doing
local_begin; previously, it could start at v=1 or 2 also. (This was
not relevant to bug i3, though I initially thought it was - was a bug
nonetheless.)  Second, in modelconfig.c:ConfigLocal(), zero the
transition p's for state 0; only local begin transitions are
active. Note that this means we've lost anything we trained for these
transitions.

DESCRIPTION     

cmscore fails because optimal parse trees from D&C and normal CYK
differ, for random sequence targets. These cmscore tests are too
aggressive. There can be more than one tree tied at the optimal score;
which one is returned is arbitrary. Looks like I'd already realized
this was a problem because cmscore has a --stringent option, but this
option was defaulting to always TRUE, instead of being parsed on the
cmd line. Made it default to FALSE, and added check on command line.

DESCRIPTION     

Alex sends a hammerhead CM and a sequence (BC050488.1/550-824) which
has two obviously bogus hits: a hit from 14..6, 31.83 bits, with only
two nucleotides aligned; and 146..90, 35.42 bits, with a little bit
more than that aligned but not enough. Does not reproduce on Linux;
Alex probably used Alpha/Tru64.

Was only initializing d=0 from 0..W-1 for the BEGL_S states; needs to
be initialized from 0..W. < W becomes <= W at initialization;
cykscan.c:133.

DESCRIPTION     

Local D&C alignment has been broken starting with version 0.7. EL self
transition scores were incorrectly being added in the outside() and
voutside() functions of smallcyk.c. This at least sometimes resulted
in the correct CYK score but incorrect parsetree, making it difficult
to detect without using cmscore (which compares the parsetree score
with the CYK score). The error was basically an off-by-one (or two in
the case of MP states) error, and a common example of it would be a EL
stretch of 2 residues rather than the correct 1 residue in the
output alignment. The error was also fixed in the outside_b() and
voutside_b() functions, so banded local D&C alignment should be clear
of this bug also. SVN revision 1678 has bug, revision 1679 does not.

DESCRIPTION     

In smallcyk.c::insideT_b_me() I was treating EL as if it has
a band. When I would pop from the stack during a traceback in an EL
state, I would add dmin[v] to it, even though dmin[v] was bogus
when v is an EL. For an example and more on this bug see
~nawrockie/notebook/6_1020_inf_banded_d_and_c_bug/00README and
00LOG. 

Sam's experience with this bug gave him messages like this: 
Assertion failed: yoffset >= 0 && yoffset <= cm->M, file
  smallcyk.c, line 7741
 Abort

I couldn't get this bug to ever crash the program, which is a main
reason there's no test case in bugs.sqc.

But I was unable to reproduce this, and could only find it with
valgrind.

DESCRIPTION     

I was incorrectly enforcing bands in the smallcyk.c::outside_b()
function, as well as in the smallcyk.c::wedge_splitter_b() function. 

In the outside_b() function, there's a special j loop where the 
code considers v->EL transitions. The loop that enforces dmin and dmax
is special b/c the code is not directly accessing beta[v][j][d] but
rather beta[v][j+{0,1}][d+StateDelta(cm->sttype[v])], so we have
to change the 'for(d=dmin[v]; d<=dmax[v]; d++)' to 
'for(d=dmin[v]-dv; d<=dmax[v]-dv; d++)'. This is line 4979 or
revision 1675 of smallcyk.c.

I couldn't get this bug to ever crash the program, which is a main
reason there's no test case in bugs.sqc.

See ~nawrocki/notebook/6_1020_inf_banded_d_and_c_bug/00README and
00LOG for more details.

DESCRIPTION     

The smallcyk::inside_b() function was incorrectly initializing alpha
cells for v = B states, using the wrong cell from the y deck (the left
child of v). A one line fix. Do 'svn diff -r 1717:1718' for the code
change.

DESCRIPTION     

cmsearch sometimes segfaults when -W is invoked at the command
line. Problem was in version 0.71 (and current development code, rev
1765) bandcyk.c::BandedCYKScan(), during the scan recursion, the fact
that d is less than W is not checked, rather d must only be < j and <
dmax[v]. The segfault occurs when d is < dmax[v] but > W. The code now
now explicitly checks to make sure d never exceeds W during the DP
recursion. scaninside::BandedInsideScan(),
scaninside.c::BandedInsideScan_jd() and hbandcyk::BandedCYKScan_jd() 
all included the same bug, and were fixed in the same manner.

NOTE: I originally "fixed" this bug with revision 1766, but later
realized that introduced another bug - so it was really fixed with
revision 1772.
