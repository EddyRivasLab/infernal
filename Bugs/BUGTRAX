ID              i1
TITLE     	vault; bad SS_cons, lone column bug
STATUS          closed
XREF            STL7 p.12

DESCRIPTION	

If cmalign was used on a set of sequences that are truncated at their
5' or 3' ends, such that the column that would contain either the left
or right pairing partners of a consensus base pair is completely
missing from the alignment (that is, only one column of a consensus
base pair appears, because it is aligned to MATP_ML or MATP_MR state),
the SS_cons line was corrupted; since the consensus annotation was
directly copied to the alignment, if one of the two columns didn't
appear, then either the < or > was missing and the SS_cons annotation
was unbalanced. This situation is now detected properly. A "lone"
MATP_ML or MATP_MR column gets annotated as a ":" instead of "<" or
">" in SS_cons.

TITLE		cmalign memory leak.
STATUS		closed

DESCRIPTION     

cmalign leaks memory. The smallcyk.c routine vinside() needed
to init a split set around z, which means that more decks can
be allocated beyond z; but the free_*_matrix routines were only
freeing r..z. But, we always alloc/init for all M+1 decks of
an alpha or beta matrix (M decks for shadows); unused decks are
NULL. So, fix by simplification: all free_*_matrix() routines
change to free all 0..M (0..M-1) decks, ignoring NULL decks,
and setting deck[v] to NULL after each free to avoid problems
w/ double free's of reused decks (e.g. END decks).

TITLE           local begins on insert states.
STATUS          closed
XREF            STL7 p.43
REPORTED_BY     Sam Griffiths-Jones
CLOSED_DATE     SRE, Tue Mar  4 14:10:08 2003
DESCRIPTION     

CYKScan() was finding hits that root at insert states, which crashes
outside(). Manifests in local alignment mode when the 0->insert->3
path is cheaper than the local begin 0->3 path. Fixed w/ two changes:
First, in scancyk.c, traceback must start at v=0 unless doing
local_begin; previously, it could start at v=1 or 2 also. (This was
not relevant to bug i3, though I initially thought it was - was a bug
nonetheless.)  Second, in modelconfig.c:ConfigLocal(), zero the
transition p's for state 0; only local begin transitions are
active. Note that this means we've lost anything we trained for these
transitions.
