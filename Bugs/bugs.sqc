# Infernal's bug tests; an sqc command file.
# SRE, Tue Dec 31 12:19:36 2002
# CVS $Id$
#
# To run on all bugs:  ../ssdk/sqc -m 2 bugs.sqc ../src/
#     only open bugs:  ../ssdk/sqc -m 1 bugs.sqc ../src/
#
# Code must be compiled w/ ${CC} = ccmalloc gcc
# to use the -m option and test all bugs, including the
# memory leaks. Else, omit the -m.
#
# Which means, by convention, all open bugs have priority 1
# in the script; all closed bugs have priority 2.
#
# bug tests are in reverse chronological order...
