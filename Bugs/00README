--------------------------------------------------

1. Get clean copy of code before starting.
   If bug is in dev code:
      cvs commit
      cvs update
      env CFLAGS=-g ./configure
      make	
   (If in legacy code, do something else.)

2. Reproduce and log the bug. 
   - Develop a small test case, with an absolute minimum of files.
     The test case must be a program that returns non-zero if the
     bug is present; this might mean a perl script.
   - Move these files to Bugs/ dir. 
   - cvs add them.
   - If nontrivial, start a page in paper notes.
   - Add an entry to BUGTRAX file; assign bug a number; record
     xref to paper notes (if needed).
     (The bug number should include a project specific prefix,
      like h for HMMER, sq for SQUID, i for INFERNAL)
   - Add test case to Bugs/bugs.sqc, at level 1 priority.
     Verify that sqc sees the bug:
     % sqc 1 Bugs/bugs.sqc (binaries dir)

3. Fix the bug.
   - verify at command line
   - verify that sqc doesn't see the bug either

4. Log the fix.
   - in Bugs/BUGTRAX:   record as CLOSED.
   - in Bugs/bugs.sqc:  make priority 2.
   - in paper notes:    details of the changes, if nontrivial.
   - cvs commit         and give a brief cvs log; include bug #!
