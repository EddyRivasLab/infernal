Checklist for an Infernal release.
SRE, Fri Jun 20 10:22:03 2008
-------------------------------------

When editing this 00CHECKLIST, it is best to edit it only in the
trunk, not in a release branch. It isn't included in releases anyway.

Subversion repository:  https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal
Trunk:                  https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/trunk/

Easel follows an 'unstable trunk' policy.
Each major release goes onto a stable branch.
Every release (even minor ones) is tagged.

There's three types of releases: major releases, minor releases, and
snapshots. A major release gets its own branch. A minor release puts
bug fixes into a major branch. A snapshot is straight from the
development trunk.

Version naming:                                        example
major              <lineage>.<major-release>                      1.0
minor              <lineage>.<major-release>.<minor-release>      1.0.1
alpha              <lineage>.<major-release>a<n>                  1.0a1
beta               <lineage>.<major-release>b<n>                  1.0b1
release candidate  <lineage>.<major-release>rc<n>                 1.0rc1
snapshot           <lineage>.<major-release>.snap<yyyymmdd>       1.0.snap20080325

1. Announce the intent to release to all developers. 
   Commit working copies on all machines (including Easel).
   Example of checking for stray or uncommitted files:
	 ./configure
         make distclean
         svn update
	 svn status
   Clean up any stray files identified by 'svn status'.
   'svn add' and 'svn commit' as needed to commit new or modified files.

2. For a major release (where we're about to create a new branch):
   First test the development trunk.
   Compile should be entirely clean when compiled -Wall.
   [MPI builds require being on login-eddy]
   

        ssh login-eddy
        ./configure --enable-debugging --enable-mpi --prefix=/groups/eddy/home/eddys/tmp/infernal
        make
        (cd documentation/userguide; make) 
        make check
	make install
	make REPOSITORY=https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/trunk RELEASE=snapxxx dist

   When trunk is clean,
        svn commit
   We're (usually) next going to move out of the trunk to the release branch.


3. For a major release, create stable release branches for Infernal and Easel.
   All subsequent bugfix releases will happen in this branch, while trunk keeps moving.
   [Query replace the version # here]
         svn copy https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/trunk\
                 https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/branches/1.0\
                 -m "created 1.0 release branch"          
         svn copy https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/trunk\
                 https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/branches/infernal/1.0\
                 -m "created Infernal 1.0 release branch"          


4. Move into a working copy of the release branch.

   For a dev snapshot, this is the normal working copy.
   For a major or minor release, this is a fresh working copy of the appropriate branch:
       cd ~/releases
       svn checkout https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/branches/1.0 infernal-release

   Don't call this working directory infernal-xx, nor infernal! Call it
   infernal-release, because later "make dist" is going to try to create
   infernal-xx as its release, and because you want to recognize that
   it's different from src/infernal.  

   If this is the first time (a new release branch), you also need to update the "svn:externals"
   so Easel is checked out from the appropriate stable branch too.

         svn proplist --verbose https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/branches/1.0
         svn propedit svn:externals infernal
           easel   https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/branches/infernal/1.0
         cd infernal
         svn update
	 svn commit

   Note the hassle with svn:externals, because it currently only accepts
   absolute URLs. Relative paths are supposed to become available in
   Subversion 1.5, which may help.


4.5 [For minor bugfix releases, on branches]:

   Figure out what bug fixes need to be merged from the development trunk.
   For Infernal 1.0rc2, this is r2497,2498; Easel r277

   Then in a working copy of the 1.0 branch, merge from trunk:

   svn update
   svn merge -r 2496:2498 https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/trunk
   cd easel
   svn merge -r 276:277 https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/trunk
   

5. Test.
   The infernal testsuite is currently relatively weak. It needs to include
   valgrind tests for memory leaks, for example.

   But even so, don't rely solely on the automated exercises and bug tests.
   Run some anecdotal examples by hand too.

   On login-eddy, because we need mpicc:

    	 autoconf
         (cd easel; autoconf)
         (cd testsuite; ln -s ../easel/devkit/sqc .)
     	 env CFLAGS="-g -Wall" ./configure --enable-mpi --prefix=/groups/eddy/home/eddys/tmp/infernal
         make
         make check

   Make a new DicF model in this version's format, for
   backwards compatibility testing:
         cd testsuite
         ../src/cmbuild DicF-$RELEASE.cm DicF.seed
         svn add DicF-$RELEASE.cm
   Add a line to exercises.sqc.

   Run some anecdotes. Examples:
        ../src/cmbuild foo.cm ../intro/trna.sto
        ../src/cmsearch foo.cm trna-regression.fa
   Run those with valgrind, too.

   Check the User's Guide.
      cd documentation/userguide
      make


6. Write (or update) release notes.
   For the first time on a new release branch, it's handy to look
   at the svn log. Replace "1534" below with the last release's SVN rev.
	 svn log -r 1534:HEAD | more
         cd easel
         svn log -r 314:HEAD | more
         emacs documentation/release-notes/RELEASE-${RELEASE}
	 svn add documentation/release-notes/RELEASE-${RELEASE}

                 sre/src                sre/easel
   Release   from-rev   to-rev      from-rev    to-rev    
   -------   --------   ------      --------    ------
   0.6:       875        1477          ?          72
   0.7:       1477       1534         72          84
   0.71:      1534       1725         84         139

   0.8:       1862       1968        149         174
       0.81 - bugfix release on 0.8 branch
   1.0rc1     1968       2485        174         272    [1.0 branch]
   1.0rc2     2485       2499        272         278    [1.0 branch] 
   1.0rc3     2499       2594        278         293    [1.0 branch]
   1.0rc4     2594       2633        293         303    [1.0 branch]
   1.0rc5     2633       2670        303         309    [1.0 branch]            
   1.0        2670       2700        309         314    [1.0 branch]
   1.0.1      2700       2995        314         420    [1.0 branch]
   
   These release notes will be merged back into the trunk later, if
   we're in a branch.


7. Update the copyright, year stamps. 
	- configure.ac (release, relcode, date)
	- COPYRIGHT (year only)

8. Commit to SVN; include release number in the log message
	 svn commit
    Remember to separately commit in Easel if changes were made there.

9. Tag.
   We don't bother to tag snapshots.
   For a new major release, or a bugfix minor release,
   the tags are made from the relevant stable branch:

      svn copy https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/branches/1.0 \
               https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/tags/1.0.1 \
               -m "tagged Infernal 1.0.1 release, from 1.0 stable branch"          
      svn copy https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/branches/infernal/1.0\
               https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/tags/infernal/1.0.1\
                 -m "tagged Easel for Infernal 1.0.1 release, from 1.0 stable branch"          

   Note: if you screw up somewhere below, and need to come back and
   re-tag, you must delete the previous tagged versions first:
     svn delete https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/tags/1.0.1 \
               -m "needed to make more changes; deleted tag; new tag coming"
     svn delete https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/tags/infernal/1.0.1\
               -m "needed to make more changes; deleted tag; new tag coming"

10. Make a distribution tarball.
   (Remaking configure scripts w/ autoconf is needed)
	 make distclean
         autoconf
         (cd easel; autoconf)
	 ./configure          <-- makes a Makefile (needed for "make dist")

    major or minor:
	 make REPOSITORY=https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/tags/1.0.1 dist
    snapshot:
	 make REPOSITORY=https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/trunk RELEASE=snap20080325 dist

   Alternatively, make -n dist' and execute commands yourself one at a
   time, under a Bourne shell like 'bash' so the for loops work.

   This exports into a infernal-$RELEASE directory, alongside the
   infernal working directory in ~/releases/. The tarball is also
   left in ~/releases/.
   
   Go into infernal-$RELEASE and make sure it looks good from the 
   perspective of a new user: start by reading the README's.

11. Build for our system (on login-eddy)
	 cd releases/infernal-xxx
	 setenv OMPI_CC      "icc"
	 setenv OMPI_CFLAGS  "-O3"
	 ./configure --enable-mpi --prefix=/usr/local/infernal-1.0/
	 make
	 make check
         (cd testsuite; ./sqc -p ../squid/ -r ../../infernal-0.52/src 4 regressions.sqc ../src/)
                                                  ^^^^ replace w/ latest old version
         
   Didn't run regressions at the 0.71 or later releases. Need to leave
   old release in the releases subdir for the regressions test above to work.

   Currently, I don't have permission to install software on login-eddy, so 
   just email Goran at this point.


12. Put on the FTP site. (on selab)
          scp 00README                  selab:/opt/www/ftp/pub/software/infernal/
          scp COPYRIGHT                 selab:/opt/www/ftp/pub/software/infernal
          scp LICENSE                   selab:/opt/www/ftp/pub/software/infernal/
          scp Userguide.pdf             selab:/opt/www/ftp/pub/software/infernal/
          scp ../infernal-1.0.1.tar.gz  selab:/opt/www/ftp/pub/software/infernal/
          ssh selab  rm -f /opt/www/ftp/pub/software/infernal/infernal.tar.gz
          ssh selab  "(cd /opt/www/ftp/pub/software/infernal; ln -s infernal-1.0.tar.gz infernal.tar.gz)"

13. Update the web site
	 cd ~/web/infernal/
         emacs index.html 
         make
	 texclean
         svn commit

14. Clean up. Don't remove the old directory though, we will (should) use it for regression testing 
    at the next release.
	cd ~/releases
        mv infernal-1.0.1.tar.gz ~/Archives/
        cd infernal-release
	make distclean
        cd ../infernal-1.0.1
	make distclean

15. Merge the changes from the "stabilized" release branch back into the trunk.

    If you're doing a minor bugfix release on a stable branch, you know the
    revs that introduced the bugfixes; merge them explicitly. For example:
       cd ~/src/infernal
       svn update
       svn merge -r 1990:1992 https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/branches/0.8
    
    If you're doing a major release on a new stable branch:
    First identify the rev #'s for when we made the release branch.
    In the release working copy:
       svn log --verbose --stop-on-copy      <-- ssdk, squid are the same
       cd easel
       svn log --verbose --stop-on-copy 
           infernal     easel
    0.6:  (r1465; Easel is r72.)
    0.7:  (r1522; Easel is r81.)
    0.71: (r1723; Easel is r139.)
    0.8:   r1966       r1967     r1968   r173
    1.0rc1 r2485        r272

    Go back to working copies of the trunks, and merge the release branches into it.
       cd ~/src/infernal
       svn update
       svn merge -r 2485:HEAD https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/src/infernal/branches/1.0

       cd ../easel
       svn update
       svn merge -r 272:HEAD https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/branches/infernal/1.0
       
    Now, the merge will always screw up the svn:externals for Infernal. Reset them.
       cd ..
       svn propedit svn:externals .
          easel   https://svn.janelia.org/eddylab/eddys/easel/trunk
    [didn't screw up on 1.0rc1?]


    1.0rc2-1.0rc5,1.0
    For subsequent rc's, the only thing that has changed is the release notes; so:
      cd ~/src/infernal/documentation/release-notes
      cp ~/releases/infernal/documentation/release-notes/RELEASE-1.0 .


    Commits.
