SRE, Thu Jul  4 10:27:28 2002
-------------------------------------

1. Make sure is up to date w/ CVS. (Worry about commits here, on
   other machines and other dirs that may have squid modifications)
        % make distclean
	% cvs update
   Clean up any stray files.

2. Update the copyright, year stamps. 
	- Makefile.in (release, relcode, date)
	- 00README (year only)
	- Licenses/COPYRIGHT.gnu (year only)
        - Licenses/gnu (year only)

3. Commit to CVS.
	% cvs commit

4. make a distribution package
	% autoconf             <-- only wrasse. Must be autoconf >=2.52
	% ./configure          <-- makes a Makefile (needed for "make dist")
	% make dist

5. Build for our system (on whelk01 or some such)
	% cd infernal-xxx
	% ./configure --enable-lfs prefix=/usr/seshare/ exec_prefix=/usr/seshare/`uname`
	% make
	% make check
 ... eventually, when we worry about installs, we'd do: ...
	% make install         <-- I don't need root to do this
	% ssh w001
	% cd /nfs/wol2/people/eddy/src/squid/squid-xxx
	% ./configure          <-- sets paths to /usr/local
	% sudo make install
	% logout
	% make distclean

6. Put on the FTP site. (on wrasse)
	% make ftpdist
