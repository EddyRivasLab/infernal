# On most Unices, you can build the package without modifying anything 
#   by just typing "./configure; make".
#
# You may want to modify the following make variables:
#   BINDIR  - where the executables will be installed by a 'make install'
#   MANDIR  - where the man pages will be installed by a 'make install'
#   CC      - which compiler to use
#   CFLAGS  - compiler flags to use

# where you want things installed
# Sort of uses GNU coding standards. ${prefix} might be /usr/local.
# ${exec_prefix} gives you some flexibility for installing architecture
# dependent files (e.g. the programs): an example ${exec_prefix} might be
# /nfs/share/irix64/
#
prefix      = @prefix@
exec_prefix = @exec_prefix@
BINDIR      = @bindir@
MANDIR      = @mandir@

# how to install the man pages; 
# cp is generally fine, unless you preformat your pages.

## You should not need to modify below this line.
