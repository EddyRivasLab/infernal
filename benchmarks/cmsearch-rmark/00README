There are 3 main sections to this 00README:

(Section 1) Overview of files
(Section 2) Performing a trial run of rmark
(Section 3) Preparing an rmark run for a cluster

These sections describe 'rmark-1' the first version of the rmark
benchmark, defined by a specific set of sequence files as described
below. 'rmark-1' is the benchmark used in the banded-cyk manuscript in
infernal/Manuscripts/banded-cyk/

To duplicate the 6 infernal benchmark runs described in the banded-cyk
manuscript see (Section 3) and the file duplicate_full_bm.sh.

=======================================================================
(Section 1) Overview of files
=======================================================================
There are 3 main perl scripts: 

o rmark.pl              - performs a benchmark run

o rmark_process_glbf.pl - converts rmark.pl output into MER and ROC
                          points based on different scoring schemes.
                          Can be run on concatenated rmark.pl output
			  from many 'clusterfied' runs (see
			  rmark_clusterfy.pl)

o rmark_clusterfy.pl    - splits up a single rmark.pl benchmark run of
			  X families against Y chromosomes into X*Y
			  mini-benchmarks and writes a shell script to
			  combine the results after they're all done.

There are two sets of sequence files relevant to rmark, family
specific files and pseudo-genome files. rmark-1 is version 1 of rmark
and is defined by 51 sets of family specific files and a pseudo-genome
made up of 20 50 Kb chromosomes with the test sequences from the 51
families embedded within it. The construction of the pseudo-genome 
and selection of the family specific files from Rfam 7.0 is described
in the banded-cyk manuscript. 

The two sets of sequence files in the rmark-1/ subdirectory:

(1) Family specific files:

The rmark-1/ subdirectory contains data files for 51 sequence
families,including training alignments and a total of 450 remote homologue test
sequences. For each family, there are four files:
	.ali  : a multiple alignment for training (STOCKHOLM format)
	.test : a set of remote homologue test sequences (FASTA format)
	.raw  : the unaligned training sequences in .ali (FASTA format)
	.idx  : list of the names of the test sequences


(2) pseudo-genome files

The 450 test sequences are embedded with 20 50 Kb randomly generated
chromosomes on either strand. The relevant files are:
	rmark-1.fa       : a fasta file with all 20 chromosomes
	rmark-1.ebd      : specifies where in the pseudo-genome each
	 	           test sequence is, each line has 6 fields:
        	           <fam name> <test seq name> <chromosome>
			   <begin posn> <end posn> <orientation>
	                   Where <orientation> is 0 for forward
			   strand, 1 for reverse strand.
	rmark-1_chrXX.fa : XX=1-20, a fasta file for each chromosome
	rmark-1_chrXX.ebd: XX=1-20, subset of rmark-1.ebd for each 
	                   chromosome
        rmark-1.idx      : a list of the families in the benchmark.

The rmark-1 benchmark has mainly be used to benchmark infernal's
cmsearch program but the rmark scripts are built in a modular way to
make it relatively easy to benchmark your own search program. To do
this you need to create a mymethod.rmm file that takes the output from
your method and generates glbf format output. See blast.rmm or
infernal.rmm (which uses infernal.pm and infernal2glbf.pl to help do
this) for examples.

=======================================================================
(Section 2) Performing a trial run of rmark
=======================================================================

This section will lead you step by step through a trial run of the
benchmark. (Alternatively, the file 'do_rmark-test.sh' is a shell
script that will perform this trial run). This trial benchmark, called
'rmark-test' is a subset of the full 'rmark-1' benchmark. 
The rmark-test benchmark contains exactly 2 of the 51 RNA families in
rmark-1: SECIS (RF00031) and tRNA (RF00005) and exactly 2 rmark-1
pseudo-genome chromosomes (numbers 12 and 13). The trial run uses
infernal v0.71's cmsearch in query dependent banding (QDB) mode and
takes about 6 minutes (on a computer with a Intel Xeon 3.0 GHz processor).

The relevant files are in infernal/benchmarks/cmsearch-rmark/rmark-test/

o RF00005.test & RF00031.test - the unaligned test sequences
o RF00005.ali  & RF00031.ali  - the query (training) alignments
o RF00005.raw  & RF00031.raw  - the unaligned query seqs 
o RF00005.idx  & RF00031.idx  - the names of the test seqs

o rmark-test.fa   - part of the rmark-1 pseudo-genome (chr 12 & 13)
o rmark-test.ebd  - info on RF00005 & RF00031 test seqs in chr 12 & 13
o rmark-test.idx  - root name (RF00005 & RF00031) (read by scripts)

Step 1 - run the benchmark via rmark.pl from the directory with rmark.pl:
IMPORTANT: execute all commands from the directory that includes the
           the rmark scripts. These instructions assume this directory
           is infernal/benchmarks/cmsearch-rmark/

- First just to get the usage:

$ perl rmark.pl
perl rmark.pl
        <.rmm rmark module>
        <.rmk rmark config file>
        <seq directory with *.ali, *.test, *.idx, *.raw files>
        <index file with family names; provide path>
        <genome file; must exist in the seq dir>
        <output root, for naming output files>

Options:
        -T <x> : set minimum bit score to keep as <x> [default: 8]

- A brief explanation of the command line arguments:
  <*.rmm rmark module>           
     - Actually runs the search program see infernal.rmm for an example
  <*.rmk rmark config file>
     - Defines options for the *.rmm module, see inf_qdb-71.rmk.
  <seq directory with...>
     - the directory with all the sequence files for the benchmark, 
       in this case it's 'rmark-test', for a full rmark-1 benchmark run
       it's 'rmark-1'
  <index file with family names>
     - file with the family names each on a separate line, for this
       example, 'rmark-test/rmark-test.idx'; provide path to the file
  <genome file>
     - the genome (or chromosome) file we're searching in must
       exist in the seq dir, along with X.ebd; for this example
       'rmark-test.fa'.
  <output root>
     - the script will output <output root>.glbf and 
       <output root>.time files, described below.

- Execute the rmark.pl script (takes about 6 minutes). 

$ perl rmark.pl infernal.rmm rmk_files/inf_qdb-71.rmk rmark-test/
       rmark-test/rmark-test.idx rmark-test.fa rmark-test_out

- 2 new files will be created in the current working dir:
$ ls -ltr | tail -2
-rw-r--r--   1 nawrockie eddy   2881 Nov 10 11:24 rmark-test_out.glbf
-rw-r--r--   1 nawrockie eddy    124 Nov 10 11:24 rmark-test_out.time

- rmark-test_out.glbf should have exactly 62 lines (if you're
  benchmarking infernal version 0.71). The .glbf line describes 
  the hits returned by cmsearch, it has the following format:

  Each line has exactly 5 fields separated by single space:
  <seq name> <score> <start posn> <end posn> <orientation>
  orientation is 0 for a hit on the forward strand, 1 for the opposite
  strand

- rmark-test_out.time reports on how long the benchmark took for
  each family and altogether. This is actual time (wall time), not
  compute time.  

Step 2 - Determine the MER score (per family and overall) as well as
         ROC points by converting the rmark-test.glbf file to
         rmark-test.all, rmark-test.fam and rmark-test.roc files using
         rmark_process_glbf.pl.

- First, to get the usage:

$ perl rmark_process_glbf.pl
perl rmark_process_glbf.pl
        <.rmm file used>
        <.rmk file used>
        <seq directory with *.ali, *.test, *.idx, *.raw files>
        <index file with family names; provide path>
        <genome root <X>, <X>.fa and <X>.ebd must be in seq dir>
        <concatenated *.glbf output from >= 1 rmark.pl runs; in CWD>
        <output root>

Options: (see code for details)
        Hit resolution options:
        -R hit : [default] each hit is a single positive/negative
        -R fnt : treat every nucleotide as a separate positive or negative.
        -R nnt : treat every non-positive nucleotide as separate negative,
                and every positive nt as a 1/length(hit) fraction of a hit

        Ignore cross-hits (hits to fam Y while searching with fam X) options:
        -I both: [default] ignore cross hits on both strands
        -I none: don't ignore cross hits on either strand
        -I opp : don't ignore cross hits on opposite strand

- A brief explanation of the command line arguments:
  The first 4 arguments are the same as for rmark.pl (see above)
  <genome root <X> ...>
     - for this script, the genome file must be named <X>.fa
       and the embed file <X>.ebd. These two files must be in the seq
       directory. The .ebd file is described briefly in section 1.
  <concatenated *.glbf output..> 
     - .glbf output from rmark.pl can be concatenated together (such
        as if rmark_clusterfy.pl was used (see below)) and used as
	input. Or a single .glbf file can be used, as we'll do in this 
	example.
  <output root>
     - the script will output <output root>.all, <output root>.fam
       and <output root>.roc files, described below.

- For more info on the options see the script's code. For our purposes
  we want to use the defaults.

- Now actually run the script:
$ perl rmark_process_glbf.pl infernal.rmm rmk_files/inf_qdb-71.rmk
       rmark-test/ rmark-test/rmark-test.idx rmark-test
       rmark-test_out.glbf rmark-test_out

- 3 new files will be created in the current working dir:
$ ls -ltr | tail -3
-rw-r--r--   1 nawrockie eddy   3629 Nov 10 11:30 rmark-test_out.fam
-rw-r--r--   1 nawrockie eddy   3218 Nov 10 11:30 rmark-test_out.all
-rw-r--r--   1 nawrockie eddy    653 Nov 10 11:30 rmark-test_out.roc

- rmark-test.fam has a ranked list of hits sorted by family
  and MER statistics for each family as well as across families 
  (the "summary MER" reported in Table 6 of the banded-cyk 
  manuscript). Positives are indicated with a '+' and negatives 
  with a '-'.

- rmark-test.all has a single master list of both families mixed
  together, with summary MER statistics.

- rmark-test.roc has points for a ROC curve in the format:
  (<x>, <y>) derived from the master list in rmark-test.all.

=======================================================================
(Section 3) Performing an rmark run on a cluster
=======================================================================

As you saw with rmark-test, the rmark.pl script can perform a
benchmark of multiple families against multiple chromosomes. But
infernal is really slow: the 6 instances of the rmark-1 infernal
benchmark described in the banded_cyk manuscript collectively take
roughly 2600 CPU hours (on a 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon). In these situations
it's useful to have a cluster. The rmark_clusterfy.pl script takes a
single rmark benchmark set of X families against Y chromosomes and
splits it up into X*Y mini-benchmarks. It also creates a directory in
which these mini-benchmark jobs will be run, and a shell script to
combine the results of all the jobs after they've finished running.

For an example, I'll walk through the steps necessary for duplicating
the rmark-1 benchmark for infernal version 0.71 in QDB mode described
in the banded-cyk manuscript (data in Table 5 (row 7), Table 6, and
Figure 5). 

To duplicate all the benchmark results in the manuscript
see the shell script 'duplicate_full_bm.sh'.

Step 1 - run rmark_clusterfy.pl to create 51 families * 20 chromosomes
         = 1020 mini-benchmarks to run on a cluster
- Here's the usage of rmark_clusterfy.pl:

$ perl rmark_clusterfy.pl
Usage: perl rmark_clusterfy.pl
        <.rmm file name>
        <.rmk file name>
        <dir with *.ali *.idx *.test and *.raw files>
	<index file with family names; provide path>
        <genome root X, X.chrlist, X.fa, X.ebd must be in PWD>
        <output file root>

Options:
        -T <x> : set minimum bit score to keep as <x> [default: 8]

- A brief explanation of the command line arguments:
  The first 4 arguments are the same as for rmark.pl (see above)
  <genome root <X> ...>
     - for this script, the genome file must be named <X>.fa
       and the embed file <X>.ebd, and a special chromosome list 
       file must be named <X>.chrlist. These three files must be in
       the seq directory. The .ebd file is described briefly in
       section 1. The <X>.chrlist file simply lists the chromosome
       files. Each chromosome file must be in the seq directory. For
       rmark-1 there are 20 chromosome files in the rmark-1 subdir
       as described in section 1.

  <output root>
     - the script will create a directory called 
       <output root>_<genome root>/, copy all necessary files to it
       for running rmark, and create <output root>.com and 
       <output root>_pp.script in the new directory, described below.

- Now actually run the script:
  $ perl rmark_clusterfy.pl infernal.rmm rmk_files/inf_qdb-71.rmk
  rmark-1/ rmark-1/rmark-1.idx rmark-1 inf_qdb-71

- The following output prints to the screen:
***************************************************************************
 Output file notice
 File name   : inf_qdb-71_rmark-1_out_dir/inf_qdb-71.com
 description : Command file with 1020 qsub calls for the cluster.
***************************************************************************
***************************************************************************
 Output file notice
 File name   : inf_qdb-71_rmark-1_out_dir/inf_qdb-71_pp.script
 description : Shell script to merge and process the collective output
               after all the cluster jobs are finished.
***************************************************************************
- The script has created the inf_qdb-71_rmark-1_out_dir and copied a
  bunch of files there. This is the directory in which the benchmark
  should be performed on the cluster. 

- The inf_qdb-71.com file has 1020 'qsub' commands that should work
  with Sun Grid Engine (SGE) version 6. Each 'qsub' command submits a
  mini-benchmark run of 1 family versus 1 chromosome to a cluster
  node. If your cluster uses something besides SGE version 6, you'll
  have to change the code in rmark_clusterfy.pl to create a different
  .com file or modify the .com file after it's created. 

 -The inf_qdb-71_pp.script is a post-processing script ('pp') that
  should be run after ALL the 1020 jobs are finished. It looks like
  this:

  $ cat inf_qdb-71_rmark-1_out_dir/inf_qdb-71_pp.script 
  rm merged_inf_qdb-71*
  cat *.glbf > inf_qdb-71_all_glbf.concat
  cat *.time > inf_qdb-71_all_time.concat
  perl ~/src/scripts/rmark/rmark_times.pl *.time > merged_inf_qdb-71.time
  perl rmark_process_glbf.pl infernal.rmm rmk_files/inf_qdb-71.rmk
  rmark-1 inf_qdb-71_all_glbf.concat merged_inf_qdb-71_hit
  cp merged_*fam ../
  cp merged_*all ../
  cp merged_*time ../
  cp merged_*roc ../

  The script concatenates the *.glbf files and *.time files from all
  1020 runs together, and calls rmark_process_glbf.pl and
  rmark_times.pl on these concatenated files. The rmark_times.pl
  script is a simple script (not described here, but see the code for
  details), it will create a merged_inf_qdb-71_hit.time file with
  the total time required for the 1020 runs. The rmark_process_glbf.pl
  script will create the files merged_inf_qdb-71_hit.fam,
  merged_inf_qdb-71_hit.all and merged_inf_qdb-71_hit.roc. The
  rmark_process_glbf.pl script is able to treat the concatenated
  .glbf output as if it were created by a single instance of the
  benchmark (a single rmark.pl run, like in the 'rmark-test' trial run
  described above). The results will be in the 4 merged* files which
  get copied up one dir when this script is run.

Step 2 - login to the cluster, submit the jobs, wait for them to
         finish and post-process the output:
  
- After logging into a cluster node that accepts job submissions, you
  can submit the jobs from the inf_qdb-71_rmark-1_out_dir/

$ sh inf_qdb-71.com 

- The longest run takes about 25 minutes (on a Intel 3.0 GHz Xeon).
- After they're all finished, run the inf_qdb-71_pp.script: 

$ sh inf_qdb-71_pp.script 

The results are in the merged_* files:

$ tail -10 merged_inf_qdb-71_hit.fam

MER:        113
MER_fp:     2
MER_fn:     111
MER_thresh: 16.38

MER statistics summed across all 51 families:
MER    (fam sum):     97
MER_fp (fam sum):     3
MER_fn (fam sum):     94

These statistics are reported in Table 6 of the banded-cyk manuscript.

To perform ALL 6 infernal runs described in Table 6, see the
duplicate_full_bm.sh shell script, which contains 6 rmark_clusterfy.pl
calls.
