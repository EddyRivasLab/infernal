# inf-1p0_nofilter.rmk:  options for a infernal 1.0 rmark-2 benchmark
#                        with no filters, running one round of search
#                        using the Inside algorithm with QDB and
#                        beta=1E-15. 
#
# This infernal benchmark corresponds to the "Infernal v1.0 (no
# filters) " ROC curve in Figure 1 of the Infernal 1.0
# applications note. To duplicate those results, cmsearch must be
# the Infernal version 1.0 executable, and the CM files used
# must be the calibrated CM files included with the supplementary
# material for the applications note (see 00README).
#
# Note: The "-Z 20" tells cmsearch to assume the database search space
# is 20 Mb (which it actually is for rmark-2). This is necessary so if
# rmark_clusterfy.pl is run, and the genome is split into single
# chromosomes and each chromosome searched individually, cmsearch will
# report E-values as if the entire genome were being searched.
# IMPORTANTLY, if you use this .rmk file for a differently sized
# database you should change the -Z 20 to -Z <x> where <x> is twice
# the size in Mb of the database ('twice' b/c the search space for
# cmsearch is actually twice the database size b/c both strands of
# each sequence are searched).

$cms = "cmsearch --fil-no-hmm --fil-no-qdb -Z 20 ";
