There are 4 main sections to this 00README:

(Section 1) Overview of files
(Section 2) Performing a trial run of rmark
(Section 3) Preparing an rmark run for a cluster
(Section 4) Differences between rmark-1 and rmark-2 

These sections describe 'rmark-2' the second version of the rmark
benchmark, defined by a specific set of sequence files as described
below. 'rmark-2' is the benchmark used in the Infernal 1.0
applications note in infernal/Manuscripts/inf-1-appnote/.
The first version of rmark, 'rmark-1' was used in the QDB paper
(Nawrocki, Eddy) in infernal/Manuscripts/banded_cyk/. 'rmark-1' can be
found in infernal/benchmarks/cmsearch-rmark/, and has it's own
00README in that dir. The similarities and differences of 'rmark-1'
and 'rmark-2' are discussed in Section 4.

To duplicate the 3 infernal benchmark runs described in the infernal
1.0 applications note see (Section 3) and the file duplicate_full_bm.sh.

To duplicate the BLASTN benchmark run described in the 1.0 app note
manuscript see the file duplicate_blast_bm.sh.

=======================================================================
(Section 1) Overview of files
=======================================================================
There are 3 main perl scripts: 

o rmark.pl              - performs a benchmark run

o rmark_process_glbf.pl - converts rmark.pl output into MER and ROC
                          points based on different scoring schemes.
                          Can be run on concatenated rmark.pl output
			  from many 'clusterfied' runs (see
			  rmark_clusterfy.pl)

o rmark_clusterfy.pl    - splits up a single rmark.pl benchmark run of
			  X families against Y chromosomes into X*Y
			  mini-benchmarks and writes a shell script to
			  combine the results after they're all done.

There are two sets of sequence files relevant to rmark, family
specific files and pseudo-genome files. rmark-1 is version 1 of rmark
and is defined by 51 sets of family specific files and a pseudo-genome
made up of 20 500 Kb chromosomes with the test sequences from the 51
families embedded within it. The construction of the pseudo-genome 
and selection of the family specific files from Rfam 7.0 is described
in the Infernal 1.0 applications note.

The two sets of sequence files in the rmark-2/ subdirectory:

(1) Family specific files:

The rmark-1/ subdirectory contains data files for 51 sequence
families,including training alignments and a total of 450 remote homologue test
sequences. For each family, there are four files:
	.ali  : a multiple alignment for training (STOCKHOLM format)
	.test : a set of remote homologue test sequences (FASTA format)
	.raw  : the unaligned training sequences in .ali (FASTA format)
	.idx  : list of the names of the test sequences


(2) pseudo-genome files

The 450 test sequences are embedded with 20 500 Kb randomly generated
chromosomes on either strand. The relevant files are:
	rmark-2.fa       : a fasta file with all 20 chromosomes
	rmark-2.ebd      : specifies where in the pseudo-genome each
	 	           test sequence is, each line has 6 fields:
        	           <fam name> <test seq name> <chromosome>
			   <begin posn> <end posn> <orientation>
	                   Where <orientation> is 0 for forward
			   strand, 1 for reverse strand.
	rmark-2_chrXX.fa : XX=1-20, a fasta file for each chromosome
	rmark-2_chrXX.ebd: XX=1-20, subset of rmark-2.ebd for each 
	                   chromosome
        rmark-2.idx      : a list of the families in the benchmark.

The rmark-2 benchmark has mainly be used to benchmark infernal's
cmsearch program but the rmark scripts are built in a modular way to
make it relatively easy to benchmark your own search program. To do
this you need to create a mymethod.rmm file that takes the output from
your method and generates glbf format output. See blast.rmm or
infernal.rmm (which uses infernal.pm and infernal2glbf.pl to help do
this) for examples.

=======================================================================
(Section 2) Performing a trial run of rmark
=======================================================================

This section will lead you step by step through a trial run of the
benchmark. (Alternatively, the file 'do_rmark-2-test.sh' is a shell
script that will perform this trial run). This trial benchmark, called
'rmark-2-test' is a subset of the full 'rmark-2' benchmark.  The
rmark-2-test benchmark contains exactly 2 of the 51 RNA families in
rmark-2: SECIS (RF00031) and SSU_rRNA_5 (RF00177, the 5' domain of
bacterial SSU ribosomal RNA) and exactly 2 rmark-2 pseudo-genome
chromosomes (numbers 12 and 13). The trial run uses infernal v1.0's
cmsearch in default mode using calibrated CM files and takes about 15
minutes (on a computer with a Intel Xeon 3.0 GHz processor).

The relevant files are in infernal/benchmarks/cmsearch-rmark/rmark-2-test/

o RF00031.test & RF00177.test - the unaligned test sequences
o RF00031.ali  & RF00177.ali  - the query (training) alignments
o RF00031.raw  & RF00177.raw  - the unaligned query seqs 
o RF00031.idx  & RF00177.idx  - the names of the test seqs

o rmark-2-test.fa   - part of the rmark-2 pseudo-genome (chr 12 & 13)
o rmark-2-test.ebd  - info on RF00031 & RF00177 test seqs in chr 12 & 13
o rmark-2-test.idx  - root name (RF00031 & RF00177) (read by scripts)

Step 1 - run the benchmark via rmark.pl from the directory with rmark.pl:
IMPORTANT: execute all commands from the directory that includes the
           the rmark scripts. These instructions assume this directory
           is infernal/benchmarks/cmsearch-rmark/

- First just to get the usage:

$ perl rmark.pl
Usage: perl rmark.pl
	<.rmm rmark module>
	<.rmk rmark config file>
	<seq directory with *.ali, *.test, *.idx, *.raw files>
	<index file with family names; provide path>
	<genome file; must be in seq dir>
	<output root, for naming output files>

Options:
	-E <x> : use E-values [default], set max E-val to keep as <x> [default: 1]
	-B <x> : use bit scores, set min score to keep as <x>
	-M <x> : pass -M <x> to .rmm module use, to use CM files in dir <x> instead of building them as needed

- A brief explanation of the command line arguments:
  <*.rmm rmark module>           
     - Actually runs the search program see infernal.rmm for an example
  <*.rmk rmark config file>
     - Defines options for the *.rmm module, see inf_qdb-72.rmk.
  <seq directory with...>
     - the directory with all the sequence files for the benchmark, 
       in this case it's 'rmark-2-test', for a full rmark-2 benchmark run
       it's 'rmark-2'
  <index file with family names>
     - file with the family names each on a separate line, for this
       example, 'rmark-2-test/rmark-2-test.idx'; provide path to the file
  <genome file>
     - the genome (or chromosome) file we're searching in must
       exist in the seq dir, along with X.ebd; for this example
       'rmark-2-test.fa'.
  <output root>
     - the script will output <output root>.glbf and 
       <output root>.time files, described below.

- Execute the rmark.pl script (takes about 6 minutes). 

$ perl rmark.pl infernal.rmm rmk_files/inf_qdb-72.rmk rmark-2-test/
       rmark-2-test/rmark-2-test.idx rmark-2-test.fa rmark-2-test_out

- 2 new files will be created in the current working dir:
$ ls -ltr | tail -2
-rw-r--r--  1 nawrockie eddy  166 Dec  4 16:51 rmark-2-test_out.glbf
-rw-r--r--  1 nawrockie eddy  124 Dec  4 16:51 rmark-2-test_out.time

- rmark-2-test_out.glbf should have exactly 5 lines (if you're
  benchmarking infernal version 1.0). The .glbf line describes 
  the hits returned by cmsearch, it has the following format:

  Each line that begins with ">" marks the beginning of results for a
  new family. Every other line has exactly 5 fields separated by
  single space: <seq name> <score> <start posn> <end posn>
  <orientation> orientation is 0 for a hit on the forward strand, 1
  for the opposite strand

- rmark-2-test_out.time reports on how long the benchmark took for
  each family and altogether. This is actual time (wall time), not
  compute time (though actual and compute time are often very
  similar).  

Step 2 - Determine the MER score (per family and overall) as well as
         ROC points by converting the rmark-2-test.glbf file to
         rmark-2-test.all, rmark-2-test.fam and rmark-2-test.roc files using
         rmark_process_glbf.pl.

- First, to get the usage:

$ perl rmark_process_glbf.pl 
Usage: perl rmark_process_glbf.pl
	<'E' if E-values used (lower score is better), 'B' if higher is better>
	<.rmm file used>
	<.rmk file used>
	<seq directory with *.ali, *.test, *.idx, *.raw files>
	<index file with family names; provide path>
	<genome root <X>, <X>.fa and <X>.ebd must be in seq dir>
	<concatenated *.glbf output from >= 1 rmark.pl runs; in CWD>
	<output root>

Options: (see code for details)
	-G     : operate in BRALIBASE3 Genome benchmark mode (not RMARK.pl)

	Hit resolution options:
	-R hit : [default] each hit is a single positive/negative
	-R fnt : treat every nucleotide as a separate positive or negative.
	-R nnt : treat every non-positive nucleotide as separate negative,
	         and every positive nt as a 1/length(hit) fraction of a hit

	Ignore cross-hits (hits to fam Y while searching with fam X) options:
	-I both: [default] ignore cross hits on both strands
	-I none: don't ignore cross hits on either strand
	-I opp : don't ignore cross hits on opposite strand

- A brief explanation of the command line arguments:
  Argument 1 tells the script whether lower scores are better (E
  values) or higher scores are better (bit scores for example). By
  default rmark.pl uses E-values. 
  Arguments 2-5 are the same as arguments 1-4 for rmark.pl (see above)
  <genome root <X> ...>
     - for this script, the genome file must be named <X>.fa
       and the embed file <X>.ebd. These two files must be in the seq
       directory. The .ebd file is described briefly in section 1.
  <concatenated *.glbf output..> 
     - .glbf output from rmark.pl can be concatenated together (such
        as if rmark_clusterfy.pl was used (see below)) and used as
	input. Or a single .glbf file can be used, as we'll do in this 
	example.
  <output root>
     - the script will output <output root>.all, <output root>.fam
       and <output root>.roc files, described below.

- For more info on the options see the script's code. For our purposes
  we want to use the defaults.

- Now actually run the script:
$ perl rmark_process_glbf.pl E infernal.rmm rmk_files/inf-1p0.rmk
       rmark-2-test/ rmark-2-test/rmark-2-test.idx rmark-2-test
       rmark-2-test_out.glbf rmark-2-test_out

- 3 new files will be created in the current working dir:
$ ls -ltr | tail -3
-rw-r--r--  1 nawrockie eddy  986 Dec  4 17:13 rmark-2-test_out.fam
-rw-r--r--  1 nawrockie eddy  585 Dec  4 17:13 rmark-2-test_out.all
-rw-r--r--  1 nawrockie eddy   46 Dec  4 17:13 rmark-2-test_out.roc

- rmark-2-test.fam has a ranked list of hits sorted by family
  and MER statistics for each family as well as across families 
  (the "summary MER" reported in Table 6 of the banded-cyk 
  manuscript). Positives are indicated with a '+' and negatives 
  with a '-'. (There are no negatives found in this example search).

- rmark-2-test.all has a single master list of both families mixed
  together, with summary MER statistics.

- rmark-2-test.roc has points for a ROC curve in the format:
  (<x>, <y>) derived from the master list in rmark-2-test.all.

=======================================================================
(Section 3) Performing an rmark run on a cluster
=======================================================================

As you saw with rmark-2-test, the rmark.pl script can perform a
benchmark of multiple families against multiple chromosomes. But
infernal is really slow: the 3 instances of the rmark-2 infernal
benchmark described in the infernal 1.0 applications note collectively
take roughly 2500 CPU hours (on a 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon), so it's useful
to have a cluster. The rmark_clusterfy.pl script takes a single rmark
benchmark set of X families against Y chromosomes and splits it up
into X*Y mini-benchmarks. It also creates a directory in which these
mini-benchmark jobs will be run, and a shell script to combine the
results of all the jobs after they've finished running.

For an example, I'll walk through the steps necessary for duplicating
the rmark-2 benchmark for infernal version 1.0 in default mode
described in the Infernal 1.0 applications note (the Infernal v1.0
default (with filters) line in Figure 1).

To duplicate all the benchmark results in the manuscript
see the shell script 'duplicate_full_bm.sh'.

Step 1 - run rmark_clusterfy.pl to create 51 families * 20 chromosomes
         = 1020 mini-benchmarks to run on a cluster
- Here's the usage of rmark_clusterfy.pl:

$ perl rmark_clusterfy.pl
Usage: perl rmark_clusterfy.pl
	<.rmm file name>
	<.rmk file name>
	<dir with *.ali *.idx *.test and *.raw files (and *ali.cm if infernal-given-cm.rmm is used)>
	<index file with family names; provide path>
	<genome root X, X.chrlist, X.fa, X.ebd must be in seq dir>
	<output file root>

Options:
	-E <x> : use E-values [default], set max E-val to keep as <x> [df: 2]
	-B <x> : use bit scores, set min score to keep as <x>
	-M <x> : pass -M <x> to .rmm module use, to use CM files in dir <x> instead of building them as needed


- A brief explanation of the command line arguments:
  The first 4 arguments are the same as for rmark.pl (see above)
  <genome root <X> ...>
     - for this script, the genome file must be named <X>.fa
       and the embed file <X>.ebd, and a special chromosome list 
       file must be named <X>.chrlist. These three files must be in
       the seq directory. The .ebd file is described briefly in
       section 1. The <X>.chrlist file simply lists the chromosome
       files. Each chromosome file must be in the seq directory. For
       rmark-2 there are 20 chromosome files in the rmark-2 subdir
       as described in section 1.

  <output root>
     - the script will create a directory called 
       <output root>_<genome root>/, copy all necessary files to it
       for running rmark, and create <output root>.com and 
       <output root>_pp.script in the new directory, described below.

- Now actually run the script:
$ perl rmark_clusterfy.pl -M cms-1p0 infernal.rmm rmk_files/inf-1p0.rmk rmark-2/ rmark-2/rmark-2.idx rmark-2 inf-1p0
- The following output prints to the screen:
***************************************************************************
 Output file notice
 File name   : inf-1p0_rmark-2_out_dir/inf-1p0.com
 description : Command file with 1020 qsub calls for the cluster.
***************************************************************************
***************************************************************************
 Output file notice
 File name   : inf-1p0_rmark-2_out_dir/inf-1p0_pp.script
 description : Shell script to merge and process the collective output
               after all the cluster jobs are finished.
***************************************************************************

  $ perl rmark_clusterfy.pl -M cms-1p0 infernal.rmm rmk_files/inf-1p0.rmk rmark-2/ rmark-2/rmark-2.idx rmark-2 inf-1p0

- The script has created the inf-1p0_rmark-2_out_dir and copied a
  bunch of files there. This is the directory in which the benchmark
  should be performed on the cluster. 

- The inf-1p0.com file has 1020 'qsub' commands that should work
  with Sun Grid Engine (SGE) version 6. Each 'qsub' command submits a
  mini-benchmark run of 1 family versus 1 chromosome to a cluster
  node. If your cluster uses something besides SGE version 6, you'll
  have to change the code in rmark_clusterfy.pl to create a different
  .com file or modify the .com file after it's created. 

 -The inf-1p0_pp.script is a post-processing script ('pp') that
  should be run after ALL the 1020 jobs are finished. It looks like
  this:

  $ cat inf-1p0_rmark-2_out_dir/inf-1p0_pp.script 
  rm merged_inf-1p0*
  cat *.glbf > inf-1p0_all_glbf.concat
  cat *.time > inf-1p0_all_time.concat
  perl ~/src/scripts/rmark/rmark_times.pl *.time > merged_inf-1p0.time
  perl rmark_process_glbf.pl E infernal.rmm rmk_files/inf-1p0.rmk
  rmark-2 inf-1p0_all_glbf.concat merged_inf-1p0_hit
  cp merged_*fam ../
  cp merged_*all ../
  cp merged_*time ../
  cp merged_*roc ../

  The script concatenates the *.glbf files and *.time files from all
  1020 runs together, and calls rmark_process_glbf.pl and
  rmark_times.pl on these concatenated files. The rmark_times.pl
  script is a simple script (not described here, but see the code for
  details), it will create a merged_inf-1p0_hit.time file with the
  total time required for the 1020 runs. The rmark_process_glbf.pl
  script will create the files merged_inf-1p0_hit.fam,
  merged_inf-1p0_hit.all and merged_inf-1p0_hit.roc. The
  rmark_process_glbf.pl script is able to treat the concatenated .glbf
  output as if it were created by a single instance of the benchmark
  (a single rmark.pl run, like in the 'rmark-2-test' trial run
  described above). The results will be in the 4 merged* files which
  get copied up one dir when this script is run.

Step 2 - login to the cluster, submit the jobs, wait for them to
         finish and post-process the output:
  
- After logging into a cluster node that accepts job submissions, you
  can submit the jobs from the inf-1p0_rmark-2_out_dir/

$ sh inf-1p0.com 

- The longest run takes about ? minutes (on a Intel 3.0 GHz Xeon).
- After they're all finished, run the inf-1p0_pp.script: 

$ sh inf-1p0_pp.script 

The results are in the merged_* files:

$ tail -10 merged_inf-1p0_hit.fam

MER:        113
MER_fp:     2
MER_fn:     111
MER_thresh: 16.38

MER statistics summed across all 51 families:
MER    (fam sum):     97
MER_fp (fam sum):     3
MER_fn (fam sum):     94

These statistics are reported in Table 6 of the banded-cyk manuscript.

To perform ALL 6 infernal runs described in Table 6, see the
duplicate_full_bm.sh shell script, which contains 6 rmark_clusterfy.pl
calls.
