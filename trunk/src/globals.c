 * Settings of the global variables used in INFERNAL,
 * such as the sequence alphabet. 
 *
 * These globals are supposed
 * to enable run-time configuration *once* -- they are not
 * to be touched after initial program startup and configuration.
 * for example, they are all assumed to be threadsafe.

/* The symbol alphabet.
 * The package is designed to be configurable for analysis of
 * a different alphabet just by changing these globals. I doubt that 
 * it would be *useful* to apply it to something other than RNA,
 * but hey, HMMER got used to do signal processing on auto engine
 * electronics and musical compositions, so what the hell do I know.
 *
 * Must deal with IUPAC degeneracies. Nondegenerate symbols
 * come first in Alphabet[], followed by degenerate symbols.
 * We also have to deal with some non-IUPAC stuff:
 * T (bah!) and X (often misused for N).
 *
 * Parts of the code assume that the last symbol is a
 * symbol for an unknown residue, i.e. 'N'.
