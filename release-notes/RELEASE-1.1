This is the official release of Infernal 1.1. In general 
Infernal 1.1rc4 (released a few months ago) is stable. Version
1.1 introduces a single bug fix involving calibration of very large
models:

 - #i40: cmcalibrate: fails on very large models (only observed for 
         eukaryotic LSU rRNA models).
