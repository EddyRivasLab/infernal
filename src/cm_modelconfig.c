 * 
 * Configuring a covariance model. The desideratum is for a CM to be
 * configured exactly once. This is done via the cm_Configure() or
 * cm_ConfigureSub() function. Configuration consists of initializing
 * the matrices and data structures that are considered always valid
 * in a CM, but are not read during CM input from a file, and putting
 * the model into local mode if necessary (CMs are always read in from
 * a file with global parameters). When a CM is about to be
 * configured, it must be 'non-configured', which means all of the
 * data not read upon CM input from a file must not be present.
 *
 * All functions that aid in the configuration process (and actually
 * modify the CM, thus removing its 'non-configured' status) are
 * static local functions in this file. This is by design - we want
 * the only way to configure a CM to be through cm_Configure() or
 * cm_ConfigureSub(), which, again, will happen exactly once per
 * model. By doing this we are limiting the possible execution paths
 * for model configuration to try and avoid the case that some
 * execution paths (of which there could be many due to the various
 * command-line options of Infernal applications) may screw something
 * up in the model.

 *
 * Purpose:  Configure a CM. Configuration options are in
 *           cm->config_opts. 
 *
 *           CM data structures that are always built or initialized:
 *
 *           - emitmap (if not yet built)
 *
 *           - all HMM banded matrices for the CM (hb_mx, hb_omx, hb_emx,
 *             hb_shmx, trhb_mx, trhb_omx, trhb_emx, trhb_shmx)
 *
 *           - CP9 HMMs (cp9, Lcp9, Rcp9, Tcp9)
 *
 *           - CP9 associated data structures (cp9map, cp9b, cp9_mx,
 *             cp9_bmx)
 *
 *           - maximum-likelihood P7 HMM (mlp7; filter p7 HMM fp7 is
 *             read from the CM file).
 *
 *           Optional configuration: 
 *
 *           - CM and cp9 HMMs (built in this function) are put
 *             into local mode if cm->config_opts & CM_CONFIG_LOCAL.
 *
 *           - QDBs and W are recalculated if cm->qdbinfo isn't
 *             already set (cm->qdbinfo->setby = 
 *             CM_QDBINFO_SETBY_INIT) or if cm->config_opts & 
 *             CM_CONFIG_QDB.
 *
 *           - W is also recalculated if cm->config_opts & 
 *             CM_CONFIG_W.
 *
 *           - all non-banded matrices for the CM (nbmx, onbmx,
 *             trnbmx, tronbmx, enbmx, trenbmx, shnbmx, trshnbmx)
 *
 *           - the scan matrix (smx) is created if cm->config_opts &
 *             CM_CONFIG_SMX 
 * 
 *          
 * Args:     cm             - the covariance model
 *           errbuf         - for error messages
 *           W_from_cmdline - W set on cmdline, -1 if W not set on cmdline (usually -1)
 *
 * Returns:   <eslOK> on success.
 *            <eslEINVAL> on contract violation.
 *            <eslEMEM> on memory allocation error.

/* Function: cm_ConfigureSub()

 *           EPN, Fri Dec  9 15:27:29 2011 [updated prior to 1.1 release]
 *
 * Purpose:  See cm_Configure()'s Purpose above. This function
 *           actually does the work for cm_Configure(). Both functions
 *           exist so we can take two additional parameters in the
 *           rare case that we're configuring a model that is a
 *           sub-model of another CM. If <sub_mother_cm> and
 *           <sub_mother_map> are non-NULL, <cm> is a sub CM
 *           constructed from <sub_mother_cm>. In this case, we're
 *           doing alignment and are constructing a new sub CM for
 *           each target sequence so running time should be
 *           minimized. Special functions for building the CP9 HMMs
 *           and for logoddsifying the model are called that are
 *           faster than the normal versions b/c they can just copy
 *           some of the parameters of the mother model instead of
 *           calc'ing them.
 *          
 * Args:     cm             - the covariance model
 *           errbuf         - for error messages
 *           W_from_cmdline - W set on cmdline, -1 if W not set on cmdline (usually -1)
 *           mother_cm      - if non-NULL, <cm> is a sub CM construced from 
 *                            <mother_cm>. In this case we use <mother_map>
 *                            to help streamline the two steps that dominate the 
 *                            running time of this function (b/c speed is an issue):
 *                            building a cp9 HMM, and logoddsifying the model.
 *           mother_map     - must be non-NULL iff <mother_cm> is non-NULL, the 
 *                            map from <cm> to <mother_cm>.
 *
 * Returns:   <eslOK> on success.
 *            <eslEINVAL> on contract violation.
 *            <eslEMEM> on memory allocation error.
 *            <eslFAIL> on other failure (errbuf filled)

/* Function: cm_localize()
 * Incept:   EPN, Tue Nov 29 13:46:29 2011 [updated] 
 *
 * Purpose:  Configure a CM for local alignment by spreading
 *           <p_internal_start> local entry probability evenly across
 *           all internal nodes, and by spreading <p_internal_exit>
 *           local exit probability evenly across all internal nodes.
 *
 *           Local entry probabilities for truncated alignment
 *           (cm->trbegin and cm->trbeginsc) are configured slightly
 *           differently, to allow inserts at the ends of the
 *           alignment. As with standard local begins,
 *           <p_internal_start> is spread evenly across all <nstarts>
 *           internal nodes, but entries into inserts are also
 *           allowed. The <p_internal_start>/<nstarts> probability
 *           for each node is divided between match and insert states
 *           of that node using a <psi> vector, psi[v] is the expected
 *           number of times state v is entered.
 *
 *           Note: to reproduce how Diana scored truncated alignments
 *           in the Kolbe and Eddy 2009 paper, set trbegin[v] to 
 *           (2 / (cm->clen * (cm->clen + 1))) for all v.
 *
 *           Local end probability is spread evenly across all states
 *           from which local ends are permitted (see code). 
 *
 *           We exploit the fact that we know we are a local static
 *           function called only by cm_ConfigureSub() and don't do
 *           any checking of the CM because cm_ConfigureSub() already
 *           has done that. If we were callable by other functions
 *           we'd want to make sure the CM wasn't already in local
 *           mode, at least.
 *           
 * Args:     cm               - the covariance model
 *           p_internal_start - prob mass to spread for local begins
 *           p_internal_exit  - prob mass to spread for local ends

/* Function: cp9_sw_config()
 * Incept:   EPN 05.30.06
 *           based on SRE's Plan7SWConfig() from HMMER's plan7.c
 *           EPN, Mon Dec 12 04:35:28 2011 [Updated, made local in cm_modelconfig.c]
 * 
 * Purpose:  Set the alignment independent parameters of
 *           a CM Plan 9 model to hmmsw (Smith/Waterman) configuration.
 *           
 * Notes:    The desideratum for begin/end probs is that all fragments ij
 *           (starting at match i, ending at match j) are
 *           equiprobable -- there is no information in the choice of
 *           entry/exit. There are M(M+1)/2 possible choices of ij, so
 *           each must get a probability of 2/M(M+1). This prob is the
 *           product of a begin, an end, and all the not-end probs in
 *           the path between i,j. 
 *            
 *           Thus: entry/exit is asymmetric because of the left/right
 *           nature of the HMM/profile. Entry probability is distributed
 *           simply by assigning p_x = pentry / (M-1) to M-1 
 *           internal match states. However, the same approach doesn't
 *           lead to a flat distribution over exit points. Exit p's
 *           must be corrected for the probability of a previous exit
 *           from the model. Requiring a flat distribution over exit
 *           points leads to an easily solved piece of algebra, giving:
 *                      p_1 = pexit / (M-1)
 *                      p_x = p_1 / (1 - (x-1) p_1)
 *
 *           Modified EPN, Thu Feb  7 15:54:16 2008, as follows:
 *           To better match a locally configured CM, if <do_match_local_cm>
 *           we disallow insertions before the first (emitting) match state, 
 *           (from I_0), and after the final (emitting) match state,
 *           (from I_M). I_0 maps to ROOT_IL and I_M maps to ROOT_IR
 *           which can never be entered in a locally configured CM
 *           (b/c the ROOT_S state MUST jump into a local begin state, which
 *            are always match states>). Also we disallow a M_0->D_1 transition
 *           because these would be impossible in a locally configured CM.
 *
 *           <do_match_local_cm> is usually TRUE, unless we're configuring
 *           the CP9 specifically for eventual sub CM alignment, where
 *           the goal is simply find the most likely start/end point
 *           of the alignment with this CP9 (in that case we want
 *           I_0 and I_M reachable).
 *           
 *           HMM probabilities are modified, but HMM is only
 *           logoddsified to get valid bit scores before leaving the
 *           function if it had valid bit scores upon entering.
 *
 * Args:     hmm    - the CM Plan 9 model w/ data-dep prob's valid
 *           pentry - probability of an internal entry somewhere;
 *                    will be evenly distributed over M-1 match states
 *           pexit  - probability of an internal exit somewhere; 
 *                    will be distributed over M-1 match states.
 *           do_match_local_cm - TRUE to make I_0, D_1 and I_M unreachable
 *                    to better match a locally configured CM.

 *                             if it's MATL or MATP then D_1 should be unreachable (it is in the CM)

 *
