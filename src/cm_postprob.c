/*****************************************************************
 * CM Inside() Functions. 
 * Important: smallcyk.c has functions named Inside() or some 
 *            variation, but these are implementations of variations of
 *            the CYK-Inside functions, as mentioned in the 2002 D&C
 *            BMC Bioinformatics publication.
 *****************************************************************/ 

/* Function: FInside()
 * 
 * Purpose:  The Inside() dynamic programming algorithm for CMs.
 *           Works directly with floats, stepping into and out of
 *           log space as necessary.
 * 
 *           Based on inside() in smallcyk.c, with the following 
 *           differences: necessarily align the sequence to the 
 *           full model (not possible to align to subtrees as in
 *           smallcyk.c's inside()), also no shadow matrix is
 *           kept because we're interested in ALL paths, finally
 *           we don't care about the best local begin state for the
 *           same reason.
 *  
 * Purpose:  Run the Inside() alignment algorithm, on a 
 *           subsequence from i0..j0, using the entire model.
 * 
 *           A note on the loop conventions. We're going to keep the
 *           sequence (dsq) and the matrix (alpha) in the full coordinate
 *           system: [0..v..M-1][0..j..L][0..d..j]. However, we're
 *           only calculating a part of that matrix: i0-1..j in the rows, 
 *           and up to j0-i0+1 in the columns (d dimension). Where this is 
 *           handled the most is in two variables: W, which is the length of 
 *           the subsequence (j0-i0+1), and is oft used in place of L in the 
 *           usual CYK; and jp (read: j'), which is the *relative* j w.r.t. the
 *           subsequence, ranging from 0..W, and then d ranges from 
 *           0 to jp, and j is calculated from jp (i0-1+jp).
 *           
 *           The caller is allowed to provide us with a preexisting
 *           matrix and/or deckpool (thru "alpha" and "dpool"), or
 *           have them newly created by passing NULL. If we pass in a dpool, 
 *           the decks *must* be sized for the same subsequence i0,j0.
 *           
 *           Note that the (alpha, ret_alpha) calling idiom allows the
 *           caller to provide an existing matrix or not, and to
 *           retrieve the calculated matrix or not, in any combination.
 *           
 *
 * Args:     cm        - the model    [0..M-1]
 *           dsq       - the sequence [1..L]   
 *           L         - length of the dsq
 *           i0        - first position in subseq to align (1, for whole seq)
 *           j0        - last position in subseq to align (L, for whole seq)
 *           do_full   - if TRUE, we save all the decks in alpha, instead of
 *                       working in our default memory-efficient mode where 
 *                       we reuse decks and only the uppermost deck (vroot) is valid
 *                       at the end.
 *           alpha     - if non-NULL, this is an existing matrix, with NULL
 *                       decks for vroot..vend, and we'll fill in those decks
 *                       appropriately instead of creating a new matrix
 *           ret_alpha - if non-NULL, return the matrix with one or more
 *                       decks available for examination (see "do_full")
 *           dpool     - if non-NULL, this is an existing deck pool, possibly empty,
 *                       but usually containing one or more allocated decks sized
 *                       for this subsequence i0..j0.
 *           ret_dpool - if non-NULL, return the deck pool for reuse -- these will
 *                       *only* be valid on exactly the same i0..j0 subseq,
 *                       because of the size of the subseq decks.
 *           allow_begin- TRUE to allow 0->b local alignment begin transitions. 
*                       
 *
 * Returns: log P(S|M)/P(S|R), as a bit score.
