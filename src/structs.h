/* Structure: cm_plan9_s
 * 
 * 03.10.06 EPN: Original intended use of CM plan 9 structure is to read a CM
 * file, and build CM plan 9 HMM based on the CM, first by determining the 
 * probabilities for each state of the HMM, and then logoddsifying the model. 
 *
 * Declaration of a CM Plan 9 profile-HMM structure.
 * Modified from a plan 7 (with (hopefully) minimal change) to mirror a CM 
 * as closely as possible.
 * 
 * The model has two forms:
 * 1. The "core" model has 0..M nodes, node 0 is special, its "match" state
 *    is really state B (which is forced silent by having hmm->mat[0] = NULL and
 *    hmm->msc[0] = NULL), its "insert" state is really state N (with emission
 *    probs hmm->ins[0]), and it has NO DELETE STATE. 
 * 
 *    hmm->t[0][CTMM]: 0. (B->M_1 transition is hmm->begin[1])
 *    hmm->t[0][CTMI]: transition from B to N (I_0); 
 *    hmm->t[0][CTMD]: transition from B to D_1;
 *    hmm->t[0][CTME]: null (transition from B to an EL state is impossible)
 *    hmm->t[0][CTIM]: transition from N to M_1;
 *    hmm->t[0][CTII]: N self transition; 
 *    hmm->t[0][CTID]: N -> D_1
 *    hmm->t[0][CTDM]: null
 *    hmm->t[0][CTDI]: null
 *    hmm->t[0][CTDD]: null
 *    
 *    t[0..M] are the state transition probs. t[k][CTME] is an
 *    end-local probability, the EL states can only be reached by a
 *    subset of match states, this probability is -INFTY for states
 *    that can't reach the EL. 
 *
 *    t[M] are special, because this node transits to the end (E
 *    state). The E state is (sort-of) treated as match state M+1, as
 *    t[M][CTIM] is the transition from I_M to E, t[M][CTDM] is the
 *    transition from D_M to E. However, t[M][CTMM] is always 0.0,
 *    the transition from M_M to E is end[hmm->M]; t[M][CTMD],
 *    t[M][CTDD], t[M][CTDI] are set as 0.0.
 *    
 *    mat[1..M] are match emission probs.
 *    ins[0..M] are insert emission probs.  (ins[0] is state N emission probs)
 *
 *    The CM_PLAN9_HASPROB flag is up when these all correspond to a fully normalized
 *    profile HMM.
 *    
 * 2. The "logoddsified" model is the configured model, converted to
 *    integer score form and ready for alignment algorithms. 
 *    bsc, esc scores correspond to begin, and end probabilities.
 *    
 *    The CPLAN9_HASBITS flag is up when both of these are ready for
 *    alignment.
 *

 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * In Forward algorithm implementations, we use a table lookup in
 * p7_FLogsum() to calculate summed probabilities in log
 * space. p7_INTSCALE defines the precision of the calculation; the
 * default of 1000.0 means rounding differences to the nearest 0.001
 * nat. p7_LOGSUM_TBL defines the size of the lookup table; the
 * default of 16000 means entries are calculated for differences of 0
 * to 16.000 nats (when p7_INTSCALE is 1000.0).  e^{-p7_LOGSUM_TBL /
 * p7_INTSCALE} should be on the order of the machine FLT_EPSILON,
 * typically 1.2e-7.
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * EPN: Infernal uses bits, not nats. 1.2e-7 =~ 2^-23 =~ e^-16.
