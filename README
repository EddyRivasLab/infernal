HMMER searches biological sequence databases for homologous sequences,
using either single sequences or multiple sequence alignments as
queries. HMMER implements a technology called "profile hidden Markov
models" (profile HMMs). HMMER is the software engine underlying many
protein family domain databases and large-scale annotation pipelines,
including the Pfam and SMART databases.

Infernal is an implementation of covariance models (CMs), which are
statistical models of RNA secondary structure and sequence consensus.
You give Infernal a multiple sequence alignment of a conserved
structural RNA family, annotated with the consensus secondary
structure. The "cmbuild" program builds a statistical profile of your
alignment. That CM can be used as a query in a database search to find
more homologs of your RNAs (the "cmsearch" program). You can also use
a CM of a representative alignment of your sequence family to create a
larger consensus alignment of any number of RNAs (the "cmalign"
program). Infernal is the software engine underlying the Rfam RNA
database (http://rfam.janelia.org).
