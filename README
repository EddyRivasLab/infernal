Infernal is an implementation of covariance models (CMs), which are
statistical models of RNA secondary structure and sequence consensus.
You give Infernal a multiple sequence alignment of a conserved
structural RNA family, annotated with the consensus secondary
structure. The "cmbuild" program builds a statistical profile of your
alignment. That CM can be used as a query in a database search to find
more homologs of your RNAs (the "cmsearch" program). You can also use
a CM of a representative alignment of your sequence family to create a
larger consensus alignment of any number of RNAs (the "cmalign"
program). Infernal is the software engine underlying the Rfam RNA
database (http://rfam.xfam.org/).
